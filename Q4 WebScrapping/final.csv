I used to just get so confused for understanding how do I actually incorporate a culture of powerful customer obsession that big companies like Amazon. Airbnb. Stripe speak so strongly about.

What does it mean? How does that change your workflow? What small optimizations can you do that can ensure you become such a company?

Yeah. you don't need a dedicated team for that - I want to list simple things you can do as a solopreneur in a garage as well.

Here's 4 learnings that I've had. from my current and previous startup. on how to build a reflex muscle for customer obsession. from 120+ overall interviews I've done.

0] an intro to the topic
Customer-centricity means you just know so much about the customer. that when you take decisions about product. you can tell exactly how your customers will react to it.

It's important because it builds very great relationship with them and they will stand by your team and product even when things don't work out that well.

1] 5hrs of talktime per week
If you're having less than 5hrs of talktime with customers. that means you either know everything about them or you need to find a different set of people to talk to. who're willing to spend time to discuss the problem.

Easy ways to get this:

Start by just asking your friends for people in their companies or families for a call and ask them to connect further. If you don't know anyone. just cold reachout your competitors' customers on Linkedin
Just ask for 25min calls. They seem shorter than 30 for some reason so I've seen people say yes and then give you the extra 5.
Ask them to not refer to "anyone". but "1 name" that they can think of - this is fast. and has 100% success rate.
Setup a communication channel on a platform they're most comfortable on. (Whatsapp. Telegram. Discord etc.) where you can just keep talking to them as friends
2] Less than a day of turnaround time
When you're a young company. you can provide near instanteneous customer support and that goes a long way in turning early adopters into evangelists. This is simple - just have them as priority notifications and swear you will reply something the moment you see a popup. Direct lines with founders who ping back quick feel very nice.

3] Organizing their feedback
This is the most important part. I'm sharing my company's template for this. It's just colorful stickies you can move around. but captures certain key snippets across multiple customers really well.

Just pick key sentences they say. tag and color them well - really helps a lot. Here's an example


At our company Recontact. we're helping people be amazing at building long-term relationships in professional and personal settings

Using this strategy. we figured out (check video) that "Maintenance" (i.e. keeping in touch with people) - was the most talked about point in our problem statement - because it had more stickies. And that realization saved us from spending 2 weeks worth of time in making "Search" in our app more efficient - because that's not what our customers cared about.

So yeah. that coloring and legend-making you did as a kid - well that's one of the key components in making a customer-centric business.

4] Building a muscle for the info
Revise. revise. revise. This. I learned from Apple CEO Tim Cook - who starts his day with reading random customer emails. Well. you can always read these stickies. Look into a simple analytics dashboard you can create for your app. - template link

You won't see it instantly. but. over time. a decision-making muscle gets built (very much like driving. music. fashion-sense) - that is very grounded in qualitative and quantitative analysis of customer feedback.

Listen to even the smallest details - you might not remember instantly. but then you'll be surprised how often you'll randomly remember a customer fact. when making a decision related to it.

In closing
You can be crazy passionate about this too - write customer snippets on your wall. listen to customer interviews at the gym. be thoughtful with delighting gifts. send personalized notes when their kids graduate etc. etc. etc.

Bottom line - Be close to the customer. even though the product will not work out. your company will. Business runs on trust and mutual respect.

"Social Capital" is simply the "network of relationships and acquantainces" that a person has developed over life".

We all hear fancy ass quotes about "making strong professional relations". "staying in touch with friends" and "your network is your net-worth". Here's a quick rundown of the best-selling way to build such social capital. since the past 80 years and beyond! Basically. become more likeable.

These are my key pointers from the book "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie. Each topic is its own tweetstorm - so kick back and read these wisdom snippets to help you build a strong people network.

With that let's dive in by understanding 6 ways to be a person who's good at making friends.

6 ways to make people like you
üí°
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
A dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love

You can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can. in 2 years. by trying to get other people interested in you

When you see a group photograph that you're in. whose picture do you look for first ?

It is the individual who is not interested in his/her fellow men/women who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring

You have to be interested in people if you wanna be a successful writer of stories

Can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them

eg : To call someone for an interview. write a letter first enclosing a list of questions that you except them to answer about themselves and their method of work

To find out someone's birthday ‚áí Begin by asking whether he/she believes the date of anyone's birth has anything to do with character or disposition

A show of interest. like every other human emotion. must be sincere

üí°
2. Smile
A smile says - "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you". That is why dogs make such a hit

A real smile. a heartwarming smile. a smile that comes from within. the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace

People who smile. tend to manage. teach and sell more effectively

Smile comes through in your voice

Hard work alone is the magic ¬†key that will unlock the door to our desires. People have succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. As the fun becomes work. people change ‚áí lose joy in it. leading business to grow dull and fail

Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Different mental attitude

Action seems to follow feeling but really. action and feeling go together and by regulating the action. which is under the more direct control of the will. we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not

Thus. the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there

Most folks are about as happy as they make up our minds to be

Picture in your mind. the able. earnest. useful person you desire to be and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual

A man/woman without a smiling face must not open a shop. It costs nothing but creates much

üí°
3. A person's name is to that person. the sweetest and most important sound in any language
The average person is more interested in his or her own name in all the other names on earth put together
Remember that name and call it easily. and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage
The executive who can't remember names can't remember a significant part of his/ her business and is operating on quicksand
Take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds
Most important ways of gaining good will is by remembering names and making people feel important
To recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion
To repeat the name several times during conversation and try to associate it with the person's features. expression and general appearance
Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices
Magic contained in a name should be realized as the single item. wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else.
The name sets the individual apart; it makes him/ her unique among all others
The info we are imparting or the request we are making takes on special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.
From the waitress to the senior executive herself. the name will work magic as we deal with others.
üí°
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention
Dale Carnegie on listening and responding ‚áí Hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise
Good conversationalists are merely good listeners who encourage a person to talk
"Yes. and" - pay attention and show indications of it from time to time with approval or disapproval.
Important personages crave a good listener but ordinary folk do too.
"Many a person call a doctor when all they want is an audience"
If you wanna know how to PREVENT making people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you. here is the recipe :
Always listen to anyone for long
Don't talk incessantly about yourself
If you have an idea while the other person is talking. wait for him/ her to finish
People who talk of themselves think only of themselves
Those people who think of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. no matter how instructed they may be
People you might be talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems
Therefore. if you aspire to be a good conversationalist. be an attentive listener
üí°
5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests
Theodore Roosevelt used to sit up late the night before. reading up on the subject in which he knew the guest is particularly interested in
Road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he/ she treasures most
The reward is an enlargement of life each time you speak to someone
üí°
6. Make the other person feel important ‚Äî and do it sincerely
If we are contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get somethin out of the other person in return ‚Äî we shall meet with the failure that we so richly deserve
Attain the feeling that you have done something for him/ her without his/ her being able to do anything in return for you
The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated ~ William James
Do unto others and you would have others do unto you
Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you". "Would you be so kind as to ‚Äî?". "Won't you please ?". "Would you mind". "Thank you ‚Äî" little courtesies like these. oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday and. incidentally. they are the hallmark of good breeding
The power of honest appreciation is stupendous as everyone considers themselves imp
Every person I meet is my superior in some way ¬†~Emerson
Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
In conclusion
Be interested. smile. remember their name. listen more. talk about their interests and make them feel important. You nail that and you find yourself as a likeable. good friend who is connected to a lot of different kinds of people very well.

This is going to be a super fast guide for developers to leverage platform development tools with VR and build cool apps. Starting with just a laptop and a Meta Quest in your hand.

Here's what the final thing looks like:


Code
Here's the GitHub Repo containing all the code - https://github.com/CMU-SV-Ronith/sem_3pi

Introduction to VR and AI-Generated NPCs
Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we interact with digital environments. offering immersive experiences that blur the lines between the virtual and real world. One of the most exciting advancements in VR is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). especially in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with users in more human-like ways. This blog post delves into the creation of an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. highlighting the technological synergy of VR and AI.

Choosing the Right Engine
When embarking on VR app development. selecting the right engine is crucial. Two prominent engines are Unity and Unreal. After extensive research and testing. Unity emerged as the preferable choice for several reasons:

Ease of Learning and Accessibility: Unity uses C#. known for its simpler syntax and automatic memory management. This choice makes Unity accessible. especially for beginners and indie developers. unlike Unreal Engine's complex C++.
Asset Store and Community Support: Unity boasts an expansive Asset Store. providing numerous resources that speed up development. Coupled with an active community. developers have access to extensive support and shared knowledge.
Versatility in 2D and 3D Development: Unity's proficiency in both 2D and 3D development offers flexibility. allowing developers to work on various project types without switching engines.
Platform Support and Integration: Unity's broad platform support. including PCs. consoles. mobile devices. and VR systems. is vital for developers targeting diverse audiences.
Strong Documentation and Educational Resources: Unity‚Äôs comprehensive documentation and learning resources are invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.
Making API Calls in C# with Code-Walkthrough
We code in C# in Unity. Here's a simple video on integrating Unity App with C# code that you write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgUIx75fJ_E

This was used for the Speech Analysis and Text Analysis functions.

To integrate AI into our VR app. we need to make API calls. This is achieved through UnityEngine.Networking. setting up coroutines for HTTP(s) communications. The process involves getting and posting information. waiting for responses. and updating the UI to reflect changes. We utilize AWS for backend services and the Dolby Media Speech Analytics API for speech analysis.

The AnalyzeText coroutine sends a user's transcript to our backend for processing. while GetAnalysisResults retrieves the analysis. The AnalyseSpeech coroutine sends audio files for speech analysis. and UploadFileToS3 handles the uploading of files to AWS S3.

References of setting up AWS in app - link. video link

API connectors in the app
private IEnumerator AnalyzeText(string transcript)
        {
            var requestJson = new
            {
                prompt = transcript
            };

            var request = new UnityWebRequest(baseUrl + "/analyzeText". "POST")
            {
                uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonUtility.ToJson(requestJson))).
                downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer()
            };

            request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type". "application/json");

            // Wait before getting results
            yield return new WaitForSeconds(20);

            // Get analysis results
            StartCoroutine(GetAnalysisResults());

            // Get transcription and analyze text
            var req = new CreateAudioTranscriptionsRequest
            {
                FileData = new FileData() { Data = File.ReadAllBytes(localPath). Name = "audio.wav" }.
                Model = "whisper-1".
                Language = "en"
            };

            var transcriptionTask = openai.CreateAudioTranscription(req);
            yield return new WaitUntil(() => transcriptionTask.IsCompleted);

            if (transcriptionTask.Exception != null)
            {
                Debug.LogError("Transcription failed: " + transcriptionTask.Exception);
                yield break;
            }

            var res = transcriptionTask.Result;
            StartCoroutine(AnalyzeText(res.Text));
        }
Creating NPCs with Inworld.ai and Trigger Words
NPCs are given life using tools like Inworld.ai. which allows for the creation of characters with specific goals and triggers. For instance. an NPC can be programmed to give a task when a user says a particular phrase. This adds an interactive layer to the VR experience. making it more engaging and realistic.

The code snippet for NPC interaction demonstrates how to set up these interactions. It includes setting up goals. defining trigger phrases. and programming responses and actions based on user interaction.

Complete Code and Overall Walkthrough
The complete code combines all these elements into a cohesive VR app. It demonstrates the integration of various APIs. handling of voice and text inputs. and interaction with NPCs. The code is structured to ensure seamless interaction within the VR environment. enabling users to experience a realistic and interactive AI interview.

This guide offers a window into the intricate process of developing an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. By combining Unity's versatile development environment with powerful APIs and AI-driven NPCs. developers can create engaging and immersive VR experiences. The future of VR and AI in app development is undoubtedly bright. offering endless possibilities for innovation and user engagement.

This article is a refresher to anyone looking to build in sales - the current approach. terminology. key insights. challenges and opportunities available in this domain.


What is a sales funnel?
A sales funnel is the marketing term for the journey potential customers go through on the way to purchase. There are several steps to a sales funnel. usually known as the top. middle. and bottom of the funnel. although these steps may vary depending on a company's sales model.

A basic sales funnel can be described as consisting of 4 levels. Marketers can take inspiration from this basic structure to design a sales funnel that suits the needs of their organisation.

Awareness: At the very top of the sales funnel is the awareness stage that is populated by the largest number of people. These people. not quite ready to be prospects yet. have just had their first interactions with your company and its offerings. They don‚Äôt know much about your brand at this stage. but are aware that it exists.
Interest: The first interactions will hook some of these newly-aware people and draw them slightly deeper into the funnel. With their interest piqued. these people will spend some time getting to know more about your company and your offerings. They might browse your website or catalogue. read your blogs. or peruse reviews from past customers.
Consideration: Armed with knowledge gathered during the interest stage. your prospects will double down on their efforts to know your company and offerings better. They may reach out to your customer service team with specific questions. or fill out a form to access more information. Remember. by this stage they may have already compared your offerings to those of your competitors. So. it is important to clearly answer their questions and help them understand how your offerings can solve their problems or needs.
Negotiation and decision: The prospect has now almost decided to purchase your product or service. Depending on the nature of your offerings. they might begin a negotiation over the price. terms of purchase. or both. But it‚Äôs fair to assume that they have a purchase intention at this stage.
At the end of this stage ‚Äîthe prospect and seller have negotiated the terms of the sale to their mutual satisfaction. and the prospect pays the seller to officially become a buyer.
Extra - Renewal or repurchase: The sale stage is not the end of the sales funnel. Soon a time will come when the sales contract is up for renewal. The customer must now decide if they want to continue with the same seller. If so. there might be a fresh round of negotiations over price and purchase terms. followed by a renewal or repurchase.

Here's an image of the currently most widely used Sales tools and the stage of the funnel they're utilized in:


Why is a sales funnel imp?
That‚Äôs the value of knowing a sales funnel: Successful sellers understand the journey a prospect is likely to take before they buy. and can make sure they‚Äôre ready to move on to each stage. They‚Äôre focused on the buyer. meeting their needs in the moment and building trust that helps move the deal forward.

So what if you ditched the sales funnel? You‚Äôd run the risk of focusing too much on the close to hit quota. pushing products or services when prospects aren‚Äôt ready. Win rates would drop because prospects wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the solutions they‚Äôre offered. and trust would be lost. No long-term relationships. no cross-sells. or upsells.

What challenges does sales have in 2023?
Challenge 1: Standing Out From the Competition
To differentiate from others. salespeople should exceed prospects' expectations by being well-versed in their CRM and sales software. and staying updated with industry trends and news.
Today. SaaS companies offer personalised email marketing. educational content. and in-depth exploratory calls with experienced representatives. Therefore. if you want to stand out from the crowd. you must be one step ahead of the already high standards of helpful. inbound selling.
Gather sales enablement materials like industry specific demos. case studies. reviews. testimonials. and analytics tools or reports.
Keep up with industry news. trends. and reports to help prospects guide strategy and show the potential ROI to their supervisors or other decision makers.
Set up alerts and automation to help you follow up with prospects at the right time and provide valuable resources.
Existing tools - Apollo.io. Outreach.io
Opportunity: This presents an opportunity to innovate in personalized and inbound selling.
Challenge 2: Meeting Quotas
A sales representative's best strategy for achieving quotas and converting leads is to make phone calls - whether they are selling remotely or not.
2. Two thirds of salespeople also use discounts and promotions. and more than half report that they increase sales. The most popular promotion among sellers is bundling a suite of products. followed by free trials.

Challenge 3: Getting in Direct Contact with Decision-Makers
With remote work becoming prevalent. establishing a strong social media presence. particularly on LinkedIn. is crucial for connecting with decision-makers.
In 2023. 67% of sales representatives worked under a hybrid or fully remote basis. and globally. almost 70% of professionals worked remotely. Many leaders and decision makers have physically moved to new locations farther away from their headquarters as industry events have largely shifted to virtual and hybrid formats.
It's crucial that salespeople establish their own presence on social media if they haven't already done so. LinkedIn was rated as the most effective platform for prospect research by nearly three quarters of sales professionals.
Challenge 4: Lack of High-Quality Leads
The first place to look when dealing with lead quality issues is sales and marketing alignment. Having a shared understanding of the ideal customer profile or buyer persona for sales and marketing teams is essential.
Assess the lifetime value of customers and which ones turn into promoters in order to develop and update these assets.
Using tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. HubSpot Sales Hub. LeadIQ. and others. sales teams find and engage with prospects at the right time after identifying target customers.
Challenge 5: Keeping Prospects Engaged Throughout the Sales Process
It is important to understand your buyer in terms of the bigger picture context so you can keep their interest throughout the sales process. which can be lengthy depending on the software package or service you are selling.
It is common for sales representatives to communicate with prospects two to seven times during B2B and B2C sales processes. which adds up when considering that most work with dozens of prospects at once.
The use of automated sales management tools and CRMs with lead intelligence and logging of communications with prospects (such as phone calls. emails. and actions) can help sales teams manage hundreds of data points to successfully acquire new customers.
Challenge 6: Difficulty Getting Meetings With Prospects
Timing is everything. Reach out at the wrong time. you‚Äôre a nuisance. Reach out at the right time. and you‚Äôre the answer to a prayer. It‚Äôs well known in the industry that the best salespeople spend most of their time on calls with prospects listening.
In order to secure meetings with qualified prospects. the best strategy is to listen. And to make it easy to meet with you. When listening for signals that a prospect is ready to meet. use these questions as a guide:
Social selling requires a combination of social media savvy and sales tools that can automatically flag key readiness indicators and send automatic alerts.
Key insights from 30+ interviews with sales and growth teams
Over the past 3 weeks. with conversations over 30 sales people. here are the key insights that stood out from my learnings in the current approach:

Efficiency in Data Management: Many use tools like Excel and Salesforce for data organization. but there's a challenge in maintaining data hygiene and integrating personal notes effectively.
Personalized Customer Engagement: Sales reps emphasize personalized interactions. like remembering personal details about clients and customizing outreach. This includes tactics like social media engagement. client lunches. and gift-giving.
Utilization of Digital Tools: Sales teams heavily rely on digital tools like CRM systems. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. and calendar reminders for tracking client interactions and industry news.
Challenges with Remote and Hybrid Sales: Adapting to remote and hybrid sales environments is a notable challenge. affecting how sales reps connect with decision-makers and clients.
Importance of Relationship Building: There's a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships. seen as crucial in high-value sales.
Adapting to Market and Client Dynamics: Sales reps must adapt to changing client personnel and market conditions.
Efficient Use of Time and Resources: Balancing time spent on tasks like data entry and client engagement is crucial. especially in cold outreach and event networking.
Conclusion
In summary. the sales funnel remains a vital concept in the sales process. guiding potential customers from awareness to purchase.

In 2023. sales teams face challenges like standing out from the competition. meeting quotas. and effectively engaging with decision-makers. particularly in remote and hybrid work environments.

Utilizing digital tools like CRMs and LinkedIn. focusing on personalized customer engagement. and maintaining efficient data management are essential strategies. Building strong relationships and adapting to market dynamics are key to navigating these challenges.

Sales teams must balance innovative selling techniques with the efficient use of time and resources to succeed in the evolving sales landscape.

This blog is from notes from an amazing talk at the OpenAI DevDay conference by Colin Jarvis and John Allard. Here's the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y)
In the realm of natural language processing. optimizing large language models (LLMs) is a formidable challenge. Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity. The performance of LLMs. often abstract and difficult to measure. requires a nuanced approach to optimization. In this blog. we‚Äôll explore a mental model of options for LLM optimization and develop an appreciation for which option to use and when.

You will leave with a foundational understanding of the two axes of optimization‚Äîcontext and LLM behavior‚Äîas well as a practical guide to the nuanced world of model refinement.

The Twin Axes of Optimization

1. Context Optimization
At its core. context optimization is about fine-tuning what the model needs to know. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:

Prompt Engineering: As the lower-left quadrant in our optimization matrix. prompt engineering is your fast lane to setting a baseline. Start by refining the prompts you feed into the LLM and observe the performance changes.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Positioned in the upper-left. RAG introduces more context. Begin with simple retrieval mechanisms. and consider fine-tuning for a more nuanced approach.
2. LLM Behavior Optimization
LLM behavior optimization delves into how the model should act. The two main strategies are:

Fine-tuning: The lower-right quadrant represents fine-tuning. which customizes the LLM‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks.
Comprehensive Approach: Sometimes. a combination of all methods is required to reach the desired performance level. An example would be integrating HyDE retrieval with a fact-checking step.
The key is to start somewhere. evaluate. and then iterate with another method.

Strategies Explored
Prompt Engineering: The Starting Block
Starting with clear. concise instructions and breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks is paramount. Giving models "time to think" and testing changes systematically can yield surprising improvements. Extending this by providing reference text and using external tools can further enhance the results.


When It Shines:

Quick testing and learning
Establishing a baseline for further optimization
Its Limitations:

Introducing new information
Replicating complex styles or methodologies

Retrieval Augmented Generation: Expanding Knowledge
By giving LLMs access to domain-specific content. RAG helps update the model's knowledge and control the content it generates to reduce inaccuracies.


When It Shines:

Introducing new. specific information
Controlling content to reduce errors
Its Limitations:

Broad domain understanding
Learning new languages. formats. or styles
Enhancing RAG:

Employ retrieval with cosine similarity and HyDE
Experiment with FT embeddings and chunking
Implement reranking and classification steps
Evaluating RAG:

On the LLM side. consider the faithfulness and relevance of the answers.
On the content side. assess the precision and recall of the context retrieved. More data does not necessarily equate to higher accuracy.

Fine-tuning: The Custom Tailor
When prompt engineering doesn't cut it. fine-tuning may be the right path. Continuing the training process with domain-specific data can optimize model performance and efficiency. For example. Canva leveraged fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to produce structured output. showcasing the power of high-quality training data.


When It Shines:

Emphasizing existing knowledge
Customizing response structure or tone
Its Limitations:

Injecting new knowledge into the model
Quick iterations on new use-cases
Steps to Fine-tune:

Data preparation
Hyperparameter selection and loss function understanding during training
Evaluation with relevant test sets and expert opinion
Fine-tuning Best Practices:

Start with prompt engineering
Establish a clear baseline
Prioritize quality over quantity in training data

The Combined Approach: Fine-tuning + RAG
Sometimes. a blend of fine-tuning and RAG yields the best results. This method allows the model to understand complex instructions with minimal tokens. creating more space for retrieved context and leading to a more robust performance.




Practical Application
The real-world application of these strategies can be as creative as generating hypothetical answers to enhance similarity searches. For example. initial baselines might yield a 69% performance rate. while a RAG with a well-crafted answer could increase that to 84%. comparable to fine-tuning. Collaborations. such as the one between Scale AI and OpenAI. demonstrate how a combined approach can optimize models to new heights of efficiency and effectiveness.


Careful what you fine-tune on
In conclusion. maximizing LLM performance isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It requires a toolkit of strategies‚Äîfrom prompt engineering to fine-tuning and beyond‚Äîeach with its own set of benefits and best-use scenarios.

there needs to be a part of education that allows students to dream and tinker and take risks. Something that makes them laugh and cry and hope and bond and stay up late in teams and chase self-assigned deadlines and ship something they would have never thought they could.

that was the ideal of buildschool.

we wanted to give students "an ecosystem of believer-builders who built things to solve problems because they wanted to". and having friends around always helps.

but the issue was. we were targeting a student base who had just come back from remote learning. who was not entirely immersed into this tinkering culture and was more driven by definite career paths.

in April 2022. Technical Society (TechSoc) started with minimal funding. full motivation and targeted growth hacks. to grow a strong community. I think the best takebacks from this journey are perseverence. dealing with ambiguity. and faith in the dreamers of tomorrow.

and our approach at TechSoc has always been - invest in the team. invest in the participants and invest in the future. here's 3 stages of how we built a community from scratch and run it well. to this day.

üí°
This journey was only possible due to the amazing contribution by Anouksha Hemanth. Prabhat Bedida. Subham Sagar. Yashaswi. Piyush Agrawal. Nikshay Jain. Vishwajeet. GK Harish and several others who made this vision real.¬†
building a team
first. we had to make team buildschool believe that the mission they were solving was important because they would be enablers of a movement much bigger than themselves. so Anouksha and me used YCombinator's startup school curriculum and actually had each manager at buildschool study startup from a perspective of product strategy. history. revenue and future steps. this helped them understand how products are built. gain confidence in talking more about these ideas and also be better thinkers in general. over 2.5 months we did multiple startup teardowns. had these people practice cold emailing founders and speaking comfortably with them. here are some of their early day case studies.

once our little army was ready. it was time to go to war. boy. was it going to be brutal.

inspiring a community
the early days were very random and we had barely any clue of processes and contacts and pretty much anything. we were just very clear on what we had to solve - get 10 student prototypes. not powerpoints. out by the next 13 weeks.

to begin with. the issue was. how do you even get people to care to solve problems? it was always cooler to do fancy PoRs that add sure-shot resume points as opposed to taking a bet on whether you and your buddies could build something or not

and even if people do care. how do you get them to actually learn this process of product building - right from design. to shipping to release to iteration and beyond? well. the answer actually lies in inspiring people.

as Simon Sinek says. if you connect with the "why" of people. you can truly move them to do unbelievable things. and we did all sorts of crazy things to get the message across. here's a video from the early days. just a whiteboard. an ai generated thumbnail and some students talking about a crazy vision of 10 teams. 10 weeks. 10 prototypes.


we did speak to people and touch upon a nerve.

to further this. we revived the history of the "fun in building" through our alumnus Kedar Kulkarni - who started off with very realistic stories of moving up the quality ladder by building computer vision fun-tools with his friends and then moving up to govt partnerships and funded projects. looking back. i think that may have struck a really strong chord - even in me.


something to remind students of where the foundation of innovation lies
sustaining the experience
10 teams selected. basic application on their plan for 10 weeks. we were just looking for grit.

to refine our teams. buildschool organized really amazing talks right from product research and UI designing. all the way up to engineering and growth post launch. we got CXOs and industry veterans to give talks for free - how did we do that? well. we just connected with the "why" of these disruptors through a cold email as simple as:


the thing that sold best was the thought of inspiring students to build more
boom! 7 high quality lectures in various domains - all conducted at zero cost. well. except for the food. it does not have to be complex - ¬†

growth hack - give people free food and they show up the 1st time. give them a memorable experience and they will keep showing up again and again.


give them pizza and they'll do amazing things
and it was hard. students want to do all sorts of things at all times. so we used accountability partners called "build buds" for each team to navigate through getting the right resources. connected to the right folks. and even actually finishing right before deadlines.

guess what - at a mini demo day amongst the teams - 9 of them had a functioning product! here's a random picture from the mini demo day at the 8 week mark.

investing in the future
by the time the 10th week ended. teams had transformed beyond what we had thought. people who didn't know coding had built apps. people who were shy on stage were presenting. people who were unsure about their passions had picked up something new and built something meaningful out of it. well. and the buildschool team - they had gone through the extreme rollercoaster of 0 attendee events (that really happened. it was really stressful) to having a great turnout of 9 products built in those 10 weeks and then we came for a repeat in the upcoming semesters with even more student interest. what makes me smile the most. is that people actually now think of this as a thing they can do full time.


end of buildsprint #1. november 2022
fun fact. one team even got incubated in the startup accelerator at IIT Madras. i look forward to more such stories.

‚≠êÔ∏è here's my takeaway - atleast once in life. i feel. every person must go through the pain and the fulfilment of building something from 0 to 1. because once you're on the other side of the storm - you gain the self-confidence to do anything you want.

that's what our vision at techsoc always has been. cheers and happy building!

Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart is a fantastic tool to deploy machine learning models. In this blog. we'll walk you through the process of using Jumpstart to deploy a model named "Llama2" and expose it as an API endpoint using AWS Lambda functions.

Step 1: Set Up SageMaker Domain and User
Begin by navigating to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Console. Here. create a domain and user profile. This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.

Step 2a: Deploy the Llama2 Model
After setting up your domain and user. head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the "Sagemaker Jumpstart" section. and from there. choose to deploy the "llama 7b model." This process usually takes about seven minutes. and at the end of it. you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this. as it will be essential for the next steps.

Step 2b: Integrating any Huggingface Model with Amazon Sagemaker
Instead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options. you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how

1. Setup development environment
We are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.

import sagemaker
import boto3
sess = sagemaker.Session()
# sagemaker session bucket -> used for uploading data. models and logs
# sagemaker will automatically create this bucket if it not exists
sagemaker_session_bucket=None
if sagemaker_session_bucket is None and sess is not None:
    # set to default bucket if a bucket name is not given
    sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()

    
    
def setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=None):
    """
    Params:
    - default_bucket: Default bucket name to use for the session

    Returns:
    - session: SageMaker session object
    - role_arn: ARN of the IAM execution role
    """
    global sagemaker_execution_role
    session = sagemaker.Session(default_bucket=default_bucket)

    try:
        sagemaker_execution_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
    except ValueError:
        iam = boto3.client('iam')
        sagemaker_execution_role = iam.get_role(RoleName="sagemaker_execution_role")['Role']['Arn']

    return session. sagemaker_execution_role

def mask_account_id(account_id):
    return '*' * len(account_id)

def main():
    sagemaker_session_bucket = None

    session. sagemaker_execution_role = setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=sagemaker_session_bucket)

    # Mask it
    account_id = sagemaker_execution_role.split(':')[4]
    masked_account_id = mask_account_id(account_id)
    masked_role = sagemaker_execution_role.replace(account_id. masked_account_id)

    print(f"SageMaker role ARN: {masked_role}")
    print(f"SageMaker session region: {session.boto_region_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC
Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker. we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend. session. region. and version. You can find the available versions here

from sagemaker.huggingface import get_huggingface_llm_image_uri


## Fetch docker image URI for the Hugging Face DLC:
# 1. backend name
# 2. Hugging face LDC version


# retrieve the llm image uri
llm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri(
  "huggingface".
  version="0.9.3"
)

# print ecr image uri
print(f"llm image uri: {llm_image}")

Hardware Requirements
Llama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B. 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.

Note: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.

MODEL	INSTANCE TYPE	QUANTIZATION	# OF GPUS PER REPLICA
Llama 7B	(ml.)g5.2xlarge	-	1
Llama 13B	(ml.)g5.12xlarge	-	4
Llama 70B	(ml.)g5.48xlarge	bitsandbytes	8
Llama 70B	(ml.)p4d.24xlarge	-	8
Note: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning. e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.

These are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B. 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks. we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances. since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.

It might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.

    else:
        print("Need to upgrade to at least 'ml.g5.12xlarge' instance")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
4. Deploy Llama2 to Amazon Sagemaker
To deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id. instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type. which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.

Note: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.

import json

from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel


def get_sagemaker_config():
    # sagemaker config
    instance_type = "ml.p4d.24xlarge"
    number_of_gpu = 8
    health_check_timeout = 300

    # Define Model and Endpoint configuration parameter

      # .'HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE': "bitsandbytes". # comment in to quantize
    }
    return instance_type. health_check_timeout. config

def create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. image_uri):
    # check if token is set
    assert config['HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN'] != "". "Please set your Hugging Face Hub token"

    # create HuggingFaceModel with the image uri
    llm_model = HuggingFaceModel(
      role=role.
      image_uri=llm_image.
      env=config
    )
    return llm_model


def main():
    instance_type. health_check_timeout. config = get_sagemaker_config()
    
    # Set role and image_uri
    role = sagemaker_execution_role
    llm_image_to_ref = llm_image
    
    # Declare llm model with create_hugging_face_model module
    llm_model = create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. llm_image_to_ref)
    
    # Deploy model to the endpoint if llm_model is available
    if llm_model:
            llm = llm_model.deploy(
                initial_instance_count = 1.
                instance_type=instance_type.
                container_startup_health_check_timeout=health_check_timeout
            )
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
5. Run inference and chat with the model
5. Run inference and chat with the model
After our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:

temperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.
max_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20. max value is 512.
repetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. defaults to null.
seed: The seed to use for random generation. default is null.
stop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.
top_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null. which disables top-k-filtering.
top_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling. default to null.
do_sample: Whether or not to use sampling ; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.
best_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs. default to null.
details: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.
return_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.
truncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.
typical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.
watermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.
You can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation

The meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:

[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>

{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]

We create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt. which converts a List of "messages" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.

def build_llama2_prompt(messages):
    startPrompt = "<s>[INST] "
    endPrompt = " [/INST]"
    conversation = []
    for index. message in enumerate(messages):
        if message["role"] == "system" and index == 0:
            conversation.append(f"<<SYS>>\n{message['content']}\n<</SYS>>\n\n")
        elif message["role"] == "user":
            conversation.append(message["content"].strip())
        else:
            conversation.append(f" [/INST] {message['content'].strip()} </s><s>[INST] ")

    return startPrompt + "".join(conversation) + endPrompt
  
messages = [
  { "role": "system"."content": "You are a friendly and knowledgeable vacation planning assistant named Clara. Your goal is to have natural conversations with users to help them plan their perfect vacation. "}
]
# define question and add to messages
instruction = "What are some cool ideas to do in the summer?"
messages.append({"role": "user". "content": instruction})
prompt = build_llama2_prompt(messages)

chat = llm.predict({"inputs":prompt})

print(chat[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Now we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.

# hyperparameters for llm
payload = {
  "inputs":  prompt.
  "parameters": {
    "do_sample": True.
    "top_p": 0.6.
    "temperature": 0.9.
    "top_k": 50.
    "max_new_tokens": 512.
    "repetition_penalty": 1.03.
    "stop": ["</s>"]
  }
}


# send request to endpoint
response = llm.predict(payload)

print(response[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Step 3: Integrate with AWS Lambda
With your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand. navigate to AWS Lambda. Here. create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:

import json
import boto3

ENDPOINT_NAME="jumpstart-dft-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b"
runtime= boto3.client('runtime.sagemaker')

def lambda_handler(event. context):
    data = event["body"]
    print(data)
    
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME.
        ContentType='application/json'.
        Body=data.
        CustomAttributes="accept_eula=true"
    )
    
    response_content = response['Body'].read().decode()
    result = json.loads(response_content)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200.
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }
Step 4: Grant Necessary Permissions
For your Lambda function to work correctly. it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions. create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17".
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0".
      "Effect": "Allow".
      "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint".
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Step 5: Expose Lambda Function as an API
Once your function is ready and permissions are in place. expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.

Step 6: Testing Your Deployment
To test the setup. use a curl command. like the one below:

curl --location 'https://khhg37edhrmibhj4ahsxqnqlha0qoqqc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "inputs":"I believe the meaning of life is".
    "parameters":{
        "max_new_tokens":256.
        "top_p":0.9.
        "temperature":0.6
    }
}'
This command sends a POST request to your Lambda function. which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.

In Conclusion
Setting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process. It offers scalability and ease of integration. making it suitable for a range of applications. For more detailed steps and best practices. you can refer to this official AWS blog.

Futurecasting. - or the art of envisioning the unforeseen. is a crucial skill in our dynamic world where the tide of events can shift unpredictably. Our perception plays a pivotal role in determining how we steer our ship into the future.

Mental Maps and Perceptions
As individuals. we need to acknowledge that our understanding of the future is inevitably tinted by personal perceptions and biases. not objective truths. Each person's mental map. the internal framework we use to navigate decisions. varies. and these maps significantly influence the decisions made regarding the future.

The Risk of Success
Ironically. success might be one of our biggest stumbling blocks. Past triumphs can make us overly reliant on the mental maps that brought us to our current position. A strategy that yielded success in the past isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work indefinitely. and overconfidence in these tried-and-tested mental maps might blind us to other possibilities and opportunities.

The Pitfall of Incorrect Maps
As the legend goes. the first set of Spanish voyagers actually thought that there was a water body connecting south-west and north-west coast of USA. And they made a wrong map. with full confidence. not knowing their mistake. Fun fact. until 16 years. voyagers used the wrong map and after multiple complaints. they were finally able to break the mental model of the government to actually update the map. And that process took 160 years total. The story of the erroneous map of the USA. used for 160 years due to stubborn belief in its accuracy. serves as a telling example. An incorrect understanding leads to misguided actions. and once a particular map (or belief) is accepted. altering it becomes a formidable challenge.

Asking Uncomfortable Questions
Futurecasting is not about comfort; it's about preparedness and openness to disquieting truths. It requires us to challenge our convictions and ask questions that make us squirm. This process involves thinking divergently about what lies ahead. questioning the mental maps we hold dear. and being willing to redraw them as needed.

Navigating with Awareness
Much like skilled sailors navigating the waters with an acute awareness of tides and winds. individuals and organizations need to craft strategies with a deep understanding of global currents and shifts. Where you eventually land is a result of both your goals and the global factors that either facilitate or hinder your journey.

Case in Point: The Oil Business

A look at the oil industry. where success is traditionally measured by rig count. reveals a critical mistake. Businesses often take one scenario. tweak it slightly. and convince themselves that they are working with different models. However. slight variations of a single view do not capture the diversity and unpredictability of the real world.

Learning from IBM

A picture from forecasting by an IBM leader. saying that PCs weren't a good enough market
IBM‚Äôs monumental miscalculation of the PC market potential‚Äîestimated at a few hundred thousand dollars. while the real value was a staggering $30 million‚Äîcost them dearly. The mental maps of their strategists. albeit successful in the past. failed to envision a scenario where PCs would be ubiquitous. missing out on a colossal opportunity and leaving an estimated $200 billion on the table - $100 billion for the software OS (Windows. then called MS-DOS) and $100 billion for the chip making market (that Intel captured)

Scenario Thinking: An Essential Tool
To prevent these decision traps. scenario thinking is invaluable. It helps to mitigate overconfidence. encourages outside-in thinking. enables seeing the full picture. corrects problem framing. and promotes asking the right questions. The goal is not to predict the future accurately but to ask better. more insightful questions. to prepare for a variety of possible futures.


Conclusion
Futurecasting. therefore. is a dance between confidence and humility. knowledge and curiosity. planning and flexibility. It's about continually asking "what if" and being prepared to redraw your mental maps to navigate the thrilling. unpredictable. and often unthinkable tides of the future. Let's escape the confines of our minds and be open to the vast. exciting possibilities the future holds.

Checkout this comprehensive analysis of various stakeholders. factors and strategic outcomes - link

If the very essence of employability is threatened then isn‚Äôt it important to talk about it?
And this time it is different. We talk about how technology shifts have been there. but this time its different. Today there are 78 million jobs that are vulnerable to be automated (IMF Report. 2021). And not enough non-routine. cognitive jobs being created (62mill) to fill this unemployment. gap(IMF Report. 2021). And lets take today‚Äôs discussion to talk about how this unfair wealth battlefield can be given its justice. It is currently important to study how this divide is ‚Äúcreated strongly due to technology‚Äôs impact on employability‚Äù.at this point time - and prepare ourselves for an ambiguous future

1. Job Displacement due to Automation
Automation has pierced through not just manufacturing sectors. but a vast array of industries. radically transforming the employment landscape. Far from being limited to routine and repetitive tasks. modern technological tools are expanding into spaces we once believed were uniquely human: content generation. graphic design. music composition. and even video editing.

Data Snapshot: Forecasts warn that a staggering 800 million workers worldwide could find their roles obsolete by 2030 due to automation. Furthermore. an alarming statistic states that 60% of all occupations have at least 30% of tasks that can be automated. signifying the breadth of the potential impact.
2. The Daunting Skills Gap
The velocity at which technology is advancing presents a conundrum. On one end. there's a surge in tech-centric roles. while on the other. there's a glaring skills deficit. This gap is even more pronounced among certain demographics: the elderly. individuals in rural settings. those encumbered by responsibilities. people with disabilities. immigrants. refugees. and professionals in non-tech domains.

Data Snapshot: The World Bank's 2020 report on the digital economy illuminated the magnitude of this disparity. noting that a mere 1% of Africa's workforce possesses ICT skills. Moreover. Deloitte's findings underline this crisis. with 64% of employees believing their organizations are unprepared to bridge this skills chasm. Adding fuel to the fire. only 17% of institutions are confident about having a future-ready workforce.
3. Escalating Income Inequality
The technological boom has inadvertently created a rift between high-skilled tech aficionados and low-skilled workers. As the former group reaps the benefits of a tech-driven economy. the latter. especially those susceptible to automation. grapples with stagnating or diminishing wages.

Data Snapshot: As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. the wage gap between those armed with a college degree and those with just a high school education has been expanding. The United Nations' ITU highlights another facet. pointing out that a lack of access to digital tools and the internet exacerbates income inequality.
4. Concentration of Wealth: The Tech Elites
It's undeniable that the tech era has given birth to a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals. This isn't just about riches but also the power and influence that come with such immense wealth. from influencing political decisions to shaping economic policies.

Data Snapshot: 2021 data reveals that the collective wealth of global billionaires skyrocketed to over $10 trillion. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. the ten wealthiest individuals added a colossal $450 billion to their coffers. To put this disparity into perspective. the top 1% of the global populace controls more than 44% of the world's wealth.
5. Gig Economy: Freedom or Feudalism?
The gig economy. bolstered by technology. promises flexibility and autonomy. Yet. it's essential to ponder whether it's a genuine avenue for empowerment or merely a modern form of feudalism. where workers. despite being 'connected'. remain isolated and vulnerable.

Data Snapshot: The gig ecosystem has witnessed explosive growth. with 36% of the U.S. workforce engaged in gig roles. cumulatively contributing to a market valued at $204 billion.
In synthesizing these insights. the digital age emerges as a paradox. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. it simultaneously casts shadows of inequality and uncertainty. As we navigate this era. it's paramount that stakeholders ‚Äì from governments to corporations to educators ‚Äì work in tandem to ensure that the digital future is inclusive. equitable. and just.

I did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software. This blog would be the story and the specifics of what a lot of people have asked me over the years. about how I made the switch and some things that you can use too. if you're interested in the same

I'll keep a major part of this blog very generic to the topic "switching streams" in general and then I'll add a section. at the end. about things I did.

Continuous learning is the name of the game
Today. learning anything is completely possible. at any given point. if you're willing to put in the work.

A lot of times we're under the notion that only a few people can learn a skillset based on the course they're "officially" enrolled in or some background experience they've had. I don't believe so. I think. that in this all-knowing YouTube and ever-improving-chatGPT era - anyone can learn anything from the Internet - for free. at their pace and convenience and from tonnes of world leading tutors.

Here are some pointers that might help you:

There is no magical playbook - to learn anything. it takes a lot of time and persistent effort of finding the right material for yourself and creating a roadmap for improving in the skill. So it's fine if you're not having a clear path to start with. There are a couple of channels that can give a clear path. but I think. that just starting from a Google or YouTube search about the topic name is a good place to start.
Taking notes really helps - Even if it's rough screenshots. scribbling random thoughts while learning or just copy-paste's of youtube videos - it works. I'm currently exploring YouTube video summarizer plugin in ChatGPT for this purpose. What's even better is revising and refining notes - for smarter reference later. It's like creating a power pellet from your learnings that you can consume at any point in the future to catch up on the skill super-fast. I used Notion for organizing whatever I've learnt into easily reference-able notes.
Motivation is 2/3rds of the game - Dedicate a fixed time slot for learning and keep struggling to make the most of it. Have very little ego. Initially you might suck - that's cool. But after breaking your head for about 1-2months. you'll not even realize but you'll naturally start seeing patterns and connections. That's the next level.
You shouldn't be afraid to suck at something new and give up if you struggle across even when understanding a paragraph of a new topic. Hell. when I was learning programming. it took me about 12hours to fully grasp and implement a 5 min youtube video about animation. But then. relentlessly pursuing on and on and on. I was able to condense 12 hr worth learnings into 5mins of revision through my notes. It's going to be hard. but if you just stick with it. it's going to be worth it.

The world is project-driven
We live in a fast paced world where most teams just look for how much value an individual can add to their team. If you've independently taught yourself and built impactful projects. no one really cares about your background coming from.

This can be harvested well to your benefit if you want to even your odds with those. who are already in the stream you like. Just build projects that rival with them. And these days YouTube has walkthroughs of any project across any stream for free - it's just so good.

Here are some key pointers to help you in this leg:

Projects are strong applications of learning - Project can mean anything - a tiny robot. a sketch. a basic app. a research paper commentary. a spreadsheet. ¬†a 5sec musical composition. a youtube video - anything. Point is - you're supposed ¬†to have employed your learnings and you're supposed to have worked super hard. It will help grasp the reason of each thing you thought was dumb but you read anyways and help translate it into moving parts of something very impactful
Start by copying other people's work - A good place to start is searching for existing projects on the internet and interpreting and recreating their work. Painters. musicians. writers. chefs - do it all the time while practicing - just patiently learning from the experience of others. This would help avoid pitfalls and learn best practices from your teachers. Again - don't just blind copy as they do. Refer - understand - try to recreate - fail - go back to refer- then understand - then try to recreate and so on.
Add your own flavor to each project - Employ a personalized touch to your project so that its unique. In the early days. I liked reading so when I came to programming projects - I would just add quotes of my favourite personalities in them as my touch. Now for you. it can be anything you like. but once you do this. you just differentiate extremely well from every other person who's just blind-copying and give a polished overall outcome
Tie the project to your ego - I get why this might be a double-edged sword but hear me out. Once you set a benchmark for the finished expectations from a project - tie it to the fact that it's something the world will see as a finished project from "you" and hence it can't fall below a certain quality threshold. For me. it used to motivate me to always push the project to completion and have it satisfy some baseline criteria.
Learn and grow with stakeholders - Some projects. you might not do alone and hence the coolest thing would be to learn from your collaborators and ensure they have a good experience working with you. Believe it or not. people and team skills are still one of the most important virtues for any team. Have fixed meetings. track your progress. hit your metrics and note down and share - what each of you learnt from the project. Projects offer collaborative opportunities and hence you can learn much beyond the books and the internet - you learn from people and in a lot of ways - what you learn will surprise you.
The more you passionately employ your learnings into real-time applications the more strongly your education will stick to you. ¬†

How to sell yourself
The next step after building projects is to share your work with the world and capitalize on it.

Few pointers on this are:

Have an online gallery - Every time you learn something. it would really help if you could maintain a online browsable gallery of your work. Be it your GitHub page or Dribbble gallery or LinkedIn profile or blog page. Just everytime you wrap up learning something. create an online snapshot for the world to view your thinking. approach. knowledge depth etc.
Look for interesting people and DM them: I used LinkedIn. Each time I found a person with interesting work - I would DM (Direct Message) them on LinkedIn and if possible. even get on a call to understand how they thought and learn from them. Seriously. it helps so much to get other people's feedback on your approach. Beyond this. there are obviously interesting conferences that you can just boldly sign up for. attend and be the newbie who talks and learns from everyone.
Confidence is free: In the early days in this new stream. you'll often feel imposter syndrome and underconfident - so start pretending otherwise. With time. it will grow into something more solid and with the knowledge and experience piling on. it would just compound. Confidence also helps express passion and clarity for the subject matter so the more you are confident about your projects and subject matter. the more people would value your work
I guess that about sums it up - in a nutshell - randomly search for ways to learn. iteratively keep sucking till you get better. build toy projects that make you happy and confidently talk about them on platforms. Rest. I'm 100% sure. the journey you take will help you figure out.

My story
Alright. now I'll be more specific about my story and things I did. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. thinking that a good college. a good job would be the only salvation. So naturally. once I got into the 4 year Civil Engineering program at IIT Madras. I thought that this would limit me from pursuing anything lateral. But in this internet-learning driven age. that's hardly the case.

To find what I liked - for a year. I dated a lot of career options - photo and videography. standup comedy. automotive engineering. consulting. designing. architecture and many countless others - mainly through hanging with different clubs of students in my college. ¬†Once I stumbled upon "software startups" I've just felt an irresistable pull to it. that stands to this day. Obviously there are a lot of days where I've doubted it too. but if it's your calling. some part of you always knows and gets attracted to it.

Now the specifics okay. I'll make it pointwise and list specific instructors and courses so that you can maybe check them out:

Disclaimer: You don't have to do it like me. Just read my opinion and do it the way most apt to you :)
I learnt the basics of programming in C Language from the hard copy book - How to C. by Prashant Kanetkar. It took me 4 months with my other college work helps understand the foundation of how a piece of code is designed. written. interpreted and executed.
Next 4 months. I learnt web development (HTML. CSS. JS) from DevEd. WebDevSimplified and Brad Traversy. I also use Laith Harb for time to time learning of new skills. Also. I used to build a lot of toy projects that these youtubers would post walkthrough videos of - this udemy course of 20 projects with Javascript is pretty sweet - link. Also learnt Git during this time
I used to also pursue first 2 hrs of any random long 7-8hr videos from FreeCodeCamp's youtube channel - anything from Data Structures and Algorithms to CyberSecurity to even color designing. I even did a bit of digital illustrations from from Gary Simon.
After this. I was consuming content and courses very fast. In the next 2months I learnt NodeJS. ¬†React and TypeScript. GraphQL. Docker and other misc topics. These are the most common industry technologies in use these days.
I even learnt basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and some Systems Designing from Algoexpert. A good place to start learning the basics of literally anything programming or computer related is Fireship - who does amazing 100second video intros of a tech.
From time to time. I've flirted with Machine Learning and AI courses from DeepLearning. ZeroToMastery and random blogs and projects and stuff. But these 2 sources are very strong for it
Next up. I was having trouble deploying apps and understanding large scale software so I studied systems designing from Gaurav Sen since it helps fall in love with the strength of computing. I also completed certifications from AWS. Google and Microsoft with the help of Stephane Mareek's amazing content
In fact. I feel that Stephane Mareek's course on Cloud Computing is a must-do for any software engineer to appreciate the beauty of internet and all cloud services that become the strong backbone of it. Just do this course. trust me.
Yeah and after that I got into generalist mindset and I was brushing up on everything from Figma for designing to Flutter for app development and was tinkering with over 10 frameworks and DevOps products at any given point for building great software.
To start getting more professional experience. I used to always offer myself up as a cheap developer to startups. I remember cold reaching out to 200+ engineers and founders (not HR since they have less of a say in hiring than actual engineers who lead teams) on linkedin over 4 months before I landed my 1st internship.
In startups. ¬†I could learn a lot everything about businesses - in the high-growth-vacuum environment that startups offer. Plus I made some money. re-invested that back in random tech-courses and business-books that I used to pick like a kid at a candy store and kept building and building a 2nd brain of mine in Notion.
I kept up my spirit and did create projects entirely from scratch on my own right after the 1st 6months even though they felt shitty and didn't work as well. Some. I couldn't even afford to keep running cause I would have to enter credit card details and I didn't have one back then. So I created YouTube videos or blog posts and shared the code as I sunsetted each project deployment. You can find a log here - link. Point is just keep trying honestly.

2nd brain in Notion
Yeah and after that I tried to run my own software startup. made some money and I failed to run it long term (here's the story of it - link).

I balanced all this work with college. Fun thing is. once you do projects. everyone wants to give you a shot - be it professors looking for programmers or startups looking for part-time developers.

A lot of times. people ask me how I managed my time or remembered so much. I do not. I just used "Google Calendar" and practiced using a lot of tools to keep reminding me to meet my goals and do my things. Every night before I go to sleep. I plan my next day's calendar for 10mins to be a good student. programmer. student-club head. brother. son. friend or any role that I feel is important dedicating my time to. Recently I even started to take Mondays to plan 3 to 4 most important things I wanted to achieve in each sphere of life in that week - like learning to cook. or reading a book. finishing an online course. deploying a project. teaching my mom about tech or even learning to play squash or salsa dancing with my friend - I tracked it all so I knew if I was missing out on time for any of my commitments.

My academics did take a hit no doubt - but I knew that I wasn't giving enough time to it and why I wasn't so it was cool.
Recently. I ended up applying to Carnegie Mellon University.

It took me a lot of research and advice - and I made this document to put down my thoughts. goals and opportunities - link. This was the single most important thing I did before choosing what I wanted to do next. I showed this doc to my seniors. people I knew and respected. family and friends and finally collated their advice into a decision.

For applying. here's all I did:

I gave the GRE test (325/340 with 4.5 in essay writing) and TOEFL test (111/120) though I didn't think GRE would have much weightage now. People say you gotta take paid courses and prep for 5 months and I don't believe it. Just mark your calendar. Go through this free material I aggregated in 2022. for GRE and TOEFL and you'll be able to get it done sooner.
Next. I talked a lot about my projects in my SoP. I wrote about majorly. creating impact through startups and software. you can give it a read - link.
My CGPA in academia was 8.01 out of 10 in my undergraduate college. I willingly didn't study as much in class or in pen-paper exams. But I pursued projects passionately and that's where I caught up on.
For Letters of Recommendation - 1. I got from the CEO/Founder 1st startup I worked with for 9months. Next. a letter from a Computer Science professor in my undergraduate whom I helped for free as a DevOps engineer on his logistics project. back in my 3rd year. I got my 3rd reco letter from my favourite Computer Science professor who had taught me 1 course (and that too I didn't score that well XD). but he just looked at my profile and work and decided to give me a shot. And yeah. that's where sometimes just asking gets you to. I just wrote him (and other profs too) an email and he called me for a 20min meeting and decided to help me out
I guess with all of that. I'm now headed for a Masters in Software Management to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I've messed up a lot. Have done a tonne of random things and kept exploring. Some of it worked. Most didn't.


In the end. I just have 1 advice - read a lot of opinions to expand your world view but at the end. internalize all that info with with what feels right in your heart. and trust me. just fuck it and do it.

Here's just a basic email thread exchange I had with 1975 passed-out alumni of Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) - exchanging talks about the way things are at IITM right now in 2023 vs in 1970. What ensued were views about IIT Madras and India in the 1970s. This is a fun anecdotal blog that tells 2 stories from different ages and how. from studying what happens in India's colleges. we can study the broader outlook of technological progress in the nation

1970s
Following is the message from an alum - Sudhir Krishna who passed out in the 1970s

B.Tech was a 5-year program. ¬† Half of the first year was spent toiling in the workshops wearing khaki uniform. ¬† The curriculum was course-heavy: ¬†Usually had 7 courses per semester. and reached 8 courses in the 7th semester (4th year). ¬† Continuous contact hours from 8 AM to 4:15 PM (with lunch from noon to 1:15 PM). ¬† ¬†Not much free time for creative projects except in the final (10th) semester. ¬† ¬†The German collaboration was still evident and some German faculty were still around. ¬† The campus population (students. faculty. administrators. staff) was much smaller than it is now. ¬† ¬†We all had single rooms in hostels. ¬† The annual cultural festival Mardi Gras was started and has now become Saarang (right?). ¬† ¬†Students were multi-talented -- academics. music. chess. bridge. quiz. drama/ acting. mimicry. sports. literary activities. etc. ¬† I myself was captain of the institute chess team. member of the institute tennis team for a couple of years. won the institute debate contest one year. represented IIT-M at the cultural festivals of other IITs. and became Under Officer in NCC Air Wing.
Also. back in the 1970s. India was still a poor country with a socialist economy. ¬† The country's global image was associated with poverty. backwardness. ¬† Only some American universities and companies were aware of the IIT brand. most notably Harvard Business School (where I got my MBA) and management consulting firms like McKinsey. ¬† Even back then. HBS admissions officers said they viewed IIT B.Techs the same way they did MIT and Caltech undergrads. ¬† But they made fun of Indian typewriters that were used for completing the application forms

I received an invitation from McKinsey for an interview that began with "Because of your Indian Institute of Technology background......."

2023
I recently graduated from IIT Madras. The hostel sector is quite lush with trees starting to form canopies above. The monkeys are not only more in number now. but more in daring as well. They're smart. bold and know how to work the system to get what they want.

The academics are strong and flexible with students having the option to pursue whatever they want. irrespective of their BTech department. A lot of application and project based courses have sprung up where we do assignments and mini-projects as opposed to just written exams.

Students are a lot in number now and it's fun to see everyone put honest hard work in their passions - right from technology and sciences to art. music. comedy and gaming. You find people of all interests and talents. The labs and workshop are still hands-on. though only about 40% of what it used to be in the 1970s. The departments have also developing into independent schools of specialization on their own with tonnes of activities. projects. lectures. events. yearly festival and more. In fact. the new department called "Engineering Design" - (near Velachery Gate) offers a lot of product designing and entrepreneurship encouragement in both- ¬†hardware and software. There's the department for management studies. humanities and flexibility of leveraging online platforms like NPTEL (https://nptel.ac.in) apart from attending in-person classes.

Here's my favourite part - the student-run project lab - Center for Innovation at IIT Madras - has over 20 teams and a 2 storey cool building. each one tinkering in topics all the way from AI. robotics. app development and racecar engg to energy efficiency. rocketry. product designing and rural tech (check this for more - https://blog.techsoc.iitm.ac.in/tech-iitm-in-5-mins/). So I'd say recovering from the pandemic. projects are at a powerful high

Hostel culture also seems to be re-igniting. guess a lot of it got hit during the pandemic years but teams like Schroeter. LitSoc and TechSoc are putting the fire back in. Athletics is strong and we won 1st in Men's championship and 4th overall in Inter IIT Sports Meet. We bagged 6 medals in Inter IIT Tech Meet (Golds in AI and entrepreneurship) and came 3rd in Inter IIT Cultural Meet.

In a nutshell. IITM has become the perfect home for pursuing anything passionately
Speaking of animals - monkeys are ruling the hostels so much so that we get a complaint email about monkey assault every week or 2. They're bold and smart and compete for food. ¬†The deer and blackbuck population is also fair and we do hangout with them in lawns sometimes. Dogs were actually moved out of the campus in 2019 since they used to hunt deer. There's a species of red ants we see all the time and snakes are barely spotted once or twice a year during rains. if anytime. Funnily. scorpions are seen near admin buildings and hostels sometimes
Workshops are lighter and we have much more time for creative activities. If you can think of it. there's a club for it working passionately.
On nearby places - Right now. Taramani is still go to for tea. snacks and cigarettes and food delivery orders. There are 2 cycle repair shops in insti. We get great breeze. most likely attributed to the greenery since the construction has blocked out the sea breeze. Student's these days hang out mostly around a huge mall outside Velachery. the food shops along the 100 ft. Road outside Taramani. Elliot's and Marina beach. Chetpet Eco-park this place called "Hidden Lake". Tada waterfalls in Andhra. and Westin bar (if you have money :)). But insti itself is I think the most happening place for so many technical. sport and cultural things that folks barely step out.
On innovation- Self-innovation and Entrepreneurship is being spearheaded by the new Director - Professor Kamakoti. In collaboration with Indian government. Professor Prabhu Rajagopal and his team - is doing several things to help students build products and eventually. companies. In fact. a couple of companies like Ather. HyperVerge. Solinas Integrity - born right inside IIT Madras - are making waves. Most recently Clueso got funded by YCombinator in 2023 and it furthered more students to do this.
On inside insti ¬†- The Dhaba outside Saras is now a full-fledged restaurant with all kinds of Indian food. juices and snacks. It's currently managed by the caterer - Zaitoon - but the tender is open for bids every 3 years. We had to recently monkey proof it due to the stealing incidents XD. The first floor of this is converted into a colorful place with a large television screen for student clubs to sit and ideate. Mummy Daddy Andhra mess outside Taramani is our go-to place for Biryani. Our tuition fees. without scholarship. are now INR 1.00.000 and hostel fees is INR 26.000 for each semester. The hostel bonding. as Srikanth said. is more shifted to clubs and messes are detached from hostels. This has helped in knowing a lot more breadth-wise bonding.
A lot of construction is going on now. There are 2 new Academic complexes. And a new sports complex is being made near the tennis courts
IIT Madras is a lot more creative. entrepreneurial. ¬† Its population is much larger. ¬† The post-graduate programs have grown a lot. ¬† Admissions quotas based on caste and gender have made the student population more diverse. ¬†(We had very few women during our time.) ¬† The IIT brand name is now world renowned. but still based largely on its undergrad B.Tech program and not yet for post-graduate and research programs. ¬† IIT alumni have distinguished themselves in America and reached the highest levels in industry and academia.

Also. India as a country has changed. ¬† It is capitalistic. entrepreneurial and technologically advanced. ¬† The country's nominal GDP is world #5 and projected to become world #3 by 2028. ¬† PM Modi. in my opinion. is a superstar on the global stage and gets royal treatment wherever he goes. ¬† Geopolitically. India is viewed as a counterweight to China. ¬† This is shaping up to be a China-India century and will be very evident by 2050. ¬† As for IITs. there are 23 of them now. ¬† While the 5 original IITs still rank at the top in India. some of the newer IITs are establishing niches of excellence for themselves. ¬†IIT Madras is ranked at the top.

Attaching a couple videos and pictures of campus here for your reference

Fruit juices are still cheap. Canteens still open till 3am. Sunlight still glitters through trees. Students still mess around but have that drive to innovate and lastly - friendships are still stupid and meaningful.

I recently graduated from Indian Institute of Technology. Madras. Here's 8 lessons I learnt from my 8 semesters and stories of how I learnt them so this is not some lame vanity post.


July 2019. entering college
Semester 1: It's a big world and trying everything. even lying outside your comfort zone is free. Be open to talk to everyone and make tonnes of friends. Semester 8 will teach you why its important. I picked up this lesson while borrowing 300 from a hostel guard to pay for pizza at 3am. attempting failed jokes at open mics and also while countlessly sitting in club orientations. It's always a good time to suck at new things :)


Semester 2: It's college. you can sign up for tonnes of things and asking anyone for help is free - people genuinely want to help. I learnt this while being disciplined and trained by the legends of the Raftar Formula Racing team as we championed 3 national trophies against all odds. Discipline and accountability take passion and convert it into wonders.


Semester 3: Just build projects that teach you skills you find cool. Persistence and hard work will help you trump all odds to be good at what you love. Maintaining motivation is 2/3rds of the game. Sitting in a COVID ridden world. using my neighbour (Jay Bafna's) WiFi to learn software development and making dumb projects like todo apps taught me that just inching a little closer to ambition. Preferably start an online presence of you that tracks your work well - write about your work and share


Semester 4: At this point. I'd say start taking bets on yourself and bold risks is the best - you're young - what's the worst that could happen? I learnt this core lesson when I decided to leave home and work at Farmako (YC S20) with a different set of legends. Having very little resources and pure hunger to survive and succeed over 9 months taught me a lot about the brilliant impact a small determined set of people can have on the world. Be stupid. take more bets. You're young and smart - you'll figure it out


Semester 5: You'll see a world of people who seem to have figured it out and gotten it right. But most of us are just winging it. I'd say at this point. just being real with a couple friends and still believing and taking bets is the hard path. I personally learnt it through shit tonne of mistakes. self-doubt and pain and tears that 2 things in life mattered - I was working on something I cared about. and I was around people I loved. I follow this principle to date. Not caring about a lot of external stimuli is a superpower you can acquire by just self-assessing.


Semester 6: You're growing now. Tension is building up and you're probably expected to have figured out life. You don't. In fact it's a good thing if you've failed over 3-4 times by now - it means you're trying and getting back-up enough. Having a vague idea of how you want to spend time - that's something I'd recommend having. A good idea here is take up something. and no matter how much it pains. see it through completion. Working with Logistics Lab. IIT Madras and Coursepanel taught me that enduring and reaching the finish line is way more important than procastinating for perfection or giving up midway. That's a major differentiating factor too.


Semester 7: You're probably multi-tasking at this point. Become boring. routine-driven - use a calendar and documentation tools to string multiple tracks together. Write a lot - it helps unclutter the mind and think clearly. I know it's boring but having control over how your time. energy and money flows by writing stuff down goes a long way. It helps aim long for a year and piece it down to what you and your team need to do today. I learnt this while helping Institute Technical Society (TechSoc). IIT Madras frame its vision from to 1700+ participants. 14 events and countless projects. I learnt that small tasks with directed effort moves mountains.


Semester 8: It's your turn to give back now. Now your old friendships will blossom and it's time to be ready for new ones. Be there as a mentor your junior self would have appreciated. Preferably take up a position of responsibility that's undervalued and difficult and lead a team through and through. no matter what it costs. I think the Inter IIT Technical Meet at Indian Institute of Technology. Kanpur where we went from stranded on a railway station to nailing medals in Kanpur (2000 miles away) in under 40 hours.


Most lessons are not my own and have been taught to me by amazing amazing mentors. friends. family members and I'm undeniably grateful to.

This blog won't solve your problems - hell. mine also took a fuckload of meanderings before I got to understand them. Think of it as more like - not repeating my fuckups. College is a mix of confusion and opportunities. wins and losses - in a short time frame so screw everything and feel free to ping me anytime if you're going through something and need a ear. Listen to all this - but the best part is - don't do it like me. do it like you. üòâ

Machine Learning projects may seem complicated at first glance. but in reality. they follow a systematic flow that. once understood. makes the whole process quite straightforward. In this blog. we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.

Let's first sing a song to kickoff this blog


In a nutshell. what are we gonna talk about
It's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section. I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead. I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!


Steps of ML
0. Become One with the Data
The initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data. identifying potential outliers. and understanding the relationship between different variables.

1. Preprocessing Your Data
Raw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning. normalization. and standardization of values.

When dealing with large datasets. it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as "batches". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor. and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.

2. Creating a Model
Starting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A "baseline" is a relatively simple. existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress. you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.

3. Compiling and Fitting the Model
Once you have decided on your model. the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function. optimizer. and the evaluation metrics. After compiling. fit your model to the training data. allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.

4. Evaluating the Model
After your model has been fitted. it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
In order to improve the model's performance. you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.

Remember. overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting. consider using techniques such as data augmentation. regularization layers. or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.

6. Iterate Until Satisfied
The above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.

8. Explore Advanced Techniques for Improvement
Once you have beaten your baseline. you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model. training for a longer period. finding an ideal learning rate. using more data. or using transfer learning.

Deep Diving into templates and tricks
Processing the Data
The first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it. thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data. where actions such as rotating. flipping. and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.

Shuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset. such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training. consider shuffling your data.

When processing your data. you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:

StandardScaler can give each feature zero-mean and unit standard deviation.
MinMaxScaler provides a non-distorting. light-touch transformation.
RobustScaler is useful for reducing the influence of outliers.
Normalizer provides row-based normalization. using l1 or l2 normalization.
Refer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.

Start with a Baseline
Starting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:

Creating a model: Define the input. output. and hidden layers of a deep learning model.
Compiling a model: Define the loss function. optimizer. and evaluation metrics for the model.
Fitting a model: Train the model to find patterns between features and labels.
Baseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. based on your project's requirements.

PyTorch
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Set the number of epochs (how many times the model will pass over the training data)
epochs = 100

# Create empty loss lists to track values
train_loss_values = []
test_loss_values = []
epoch_count = []

# Put data on the available device
# Without this. error will happen (not all model/data on device)
X_train = X_train.to(device)
X_test = X_test.to(device)
y_train = y_train.to(device)
y_test = y_test.to(device)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    ### Training

    # Put model in training mode (this is the default state of a model)
    model_0.train()

    # 1. Forward pass on train data using the forward() method inside 
    y_pred = model_0(X_train)
    # print(y_pred)

    # 2. Calculate the loss (how different are our models predictions to the ground truth)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred. y_train)

    # 3. Zero grad of the optimizer
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # 4. Loss backwards
    loss.backward()

    # 5. Progress the optimizer
    optimizer.step()

    ### Testing

    # Put the model in evaluation mode
    model_0.eval()

    with torch.inference_mode():
      # 1. Forward pass on test data
      test_pred = model_0(X_test)

      # 2. Caculate loss on test data
      test_loss = loss_fn(test_pred. y_test.type(torch.float)) # predictions come in torch.float datatype. so comparisons need to be done with tensors of the same type

      # Print out what's happening
      if epoch % 10 == 0:
            epoch_count.append(epoch)
            train_loss_values.append(loss.detach().numpy())
            test_loss_values.append(test_loss.detach().numpy())
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch} | MAE Train Loss: {loss} | MAE Test Loss: {test_loss} ")
Tensorflow
# Now our data is normalized. let's build a model to find pattern

# Set a random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# 1. Create a model
model_2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28.28)).
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10. activation="softmax").
])

# 2. Compile the model
model_2.compile(
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy().
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam().
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# 3. Train the model
norm_history = model_2.fit(
    train_data_norm.
    train_labels.
    epochs = 10.
    validation_data = (
        test_data_norm.
        test_labels
    )
)
Plotting training and testing loss
## Plotting training and test loss

# Plot the loss curves
plt.plot(epoch_count. train_loss_values. label="Train loss")
plt.plot(epoch_count. test_loss_values. label="Test loss")
plt.title("Training and test loss curves")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.legend();
Evaluating Our Model
Visualizing our model's predictions and its performance metrics is an integral part of model evaluation. Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems. evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.

Tracking Experiments
Visualizing our model's predictions
Apart from that. a good way to proceed is visualize. visualize. visualize!

It's a good idea to visualize

The data - What data are we working with? What does the data look like?
The model itself - what does our model look like
The training of a model - How does a model perform as it is learning?
The predictions of the model -How do the predictions match up against the ground truth (the original labels)
To visualize our model's predictions. it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values

def plot_predictions(train_data=X_train. 
                     train_labels=y_train. 
                     test_data=X_test. 
                     test_labels=y_test. 
                     predictions=None):
  """
  Plots training data. test data and compares predictions.
  """
  plt.figure(figsize=(10. 7))

  # Plot training data in blue
  plt.scatter(train_data. train_labels. c="b". s=4. label="Training data")
  
  # Plot test data in green
  plt.scatter(test_data. test_labels. c="g". s=4. label="Testing data")

  if predictions is not None:
    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)
    plt.scatter(test_data. predictions. c="r". s=4. label="Predictions")

  # Show the legend
  plt.legend(prop={"size": 14});
To efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations. it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.

Improving Our Model
Build the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....

Improving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation. compilation. and training stages.

During the model creation stage. you might add more layers. increase the number of hidden units in each layer. or change the activation function. In the compilation stage. changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.

This process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as "hyperparameter tuning".

Approaches to improve accuracy

Get more data -> Get a larger dataset that we can train our model on
Hyperparameter tuning -> Use more hidden layers or increase number of neurons in each hidden layer
Train for longer -> Give your model more of a chance to find patterns in the dataset
Save a Model
Saving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment. like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow. depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch. the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().

PyTorch code
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Create models directory 
MODEL_PATH = Path("models")
MODEL_PATH.mkdir(parents=True. exist_ok=True)

# 2. Create model save path 
MODEL_NAME = "01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth"
MODEL_SAVE_PATH = MODEL_PATH / MODEL_NAME

# 3. Save the model state dict 
print(f"Saving model to: {MODEL_SAVE_PATH}")
torch.save(obj=model_0.state_dict(). # only saving the state_dict() only saves the models learned parameters
           f=MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
Run on GPU
Running your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function. where device is set to "cuda" for GPU or "cpu" for the Central Processing Unit.

Conclusion
In conclusion. understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively. Remember. machine learning is an iterative process. and it's okay to go back and forth between steps to improve your model's performance.

Introduction
As we progress in the age of digital transformation. organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework. an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda. is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management. which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless. and how does it function? In this blog. we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.

What is AWS Serverless Framework and How is it Helpful?
The Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes. either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda. you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.

Installing Node.js and Python on Your MacOS Machine
Before we start with the Serverless framework. we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.

To install Node.js. we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:

brew install node

For Python. MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However. it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:

brew install python

To verify successful installation. type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.

Setting Up AWS and Serverless CLI on MacOS Machine
After installing Node.js and Python. it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:

npm i -g serverless

Upon installation. verify the version using serverless -v command.

To deploy your functions on AWS. you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command. replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin

How to Invoke. Deploy. and See Logs of Serverless Lambda Functions
To create a new service or function. use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example. to create a Python service:

sls create --template aws-python --path myService

To deploy this function to AWS. use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only. use sls deploy function -f functionName.

To test a function on AWS. use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.

What is AWS SAM and How to Set it Up on MacOS
AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions. APIs. databases. and event source mappings.

To install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS. first. install the AWS CLI:

brew install awscli

Next. install AWS SAM:

brew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli

Initialize a new SAM application using sam init. choose your desired runtime (e.g.. Python). and template. To build your application. navigate to the project directory and use sam build.

You can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API. you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.

To deploy your application. use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke "FunctionName".

If you need to delete your stack for any reason. you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.

You can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode. click on "Add Debug Configuration" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.

For Python packages management. you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.

Conclusion and Why Serverless is Useful for Cost-Saving
As you can see. the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating. deploying. and managing serverless applications. Moreover. by leveraging these tools. we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.

Serverless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage. it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions. which leads to significant cost savings. especially for applications with variable workloads.

We hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.

TechSoc IIT Madras was one of the most stressful and fulfilling decisions I made in my last year in institute. We upscaled the tech culture at the institute through organizing 20+ competitions. 15+ guest lectures - resulting in 22
products. events impacting 2000+ students. I‚Äôd personally recommend this to any person who shares these 2 traits -

passion of driving a solid tech culture at our university
willingness to test their limits to stand for something bigger than themselves
I‚Äôll talk mainly about 6 things about my tenure as TechSoc Head from 2022 to 2023. where we captured the engagement of over 2000+ students. having conducted 15+ guest lectures and 20+ technical events.

The Initiatives
The Experience
The Growth
The De-merits
A crazy story
Cool stuff I got to do
FYI - Although this blog is all motivational stuff. we failed a tonne of times. but we did end up making people smile and make amazing things - and that's what it's all about.

The initiatives
My approach was and always has been - invest in the team. then invest in the customer and then invest in the future. The fun part about this 3 step process is the more you invest in the earlier phases. you're actually also investing well enough in the latter parts.

Investing in the team
The most important part was always that each member on the team felt proud and challenged and happy about the work we did. They had to grow. they had to be happy and challenge their own problem solving skills - else it wasn't worth it.

So here are a couple things I tried and liked:


not the full team. some suckers missed picture day
A training period
Spent atleast a month for new joinees to get used to "entrepreneurial activities" - like studying companies. making presentations and pitching. drafting detailed reports. running collaborative projects. cold emailing. corporate relations. This helped the team learn a lot in a short period of time and gain confidence.

Here's a syllabus if it helps - link

But yeah. if you want top-quality. hard-working. smart people actually working with you on your vision - gotta train your army to fight. You can start by defining the vision of your team. and what culture you want to carry into this.

Meeting structuring
College is a complex time with lotta priorities. commitments and spontaneous plans. It is important to have a definite meeting structure so that you stay consistent and add a punctuality aspect to respect everyone's time.

If anyone came late. they bought ice-cream to everyone who came before.
If the meeting didn't end on time. then I would buy ice-cream for everyone in the meeting
Every meeting had a document and actionables that people could take back so we always met with a direction. discussed agenda as per time and walked away with usable data and direction.
This structure is something I learned from Sharavanakumar at Khatabook and to this day. I'm grateful for it.

OKRs
OKRs - helping break down the overall vision into just 3 things each of the 18 of us had to get right each week - while working with each other. We were 18 disruptors - 54 things per week. pointing in 1 direction - helped us grow like crazy.

Team Happiness and Culture
At TechSoc. you always get a birthday cake. If you're in person - team folks even show up for your celebration at 12AM. We ensured that in our weekly retros. we had shoutouts for everyone who did great work in that week. Every event we saved on. the surplus would go back to team treats and gifting goodies. We were transparent about our money and trusted each other with it. Apart from that. we'd enjoy late night sessions on the lawns playing games (Mafia. Truth and Dare. "Albatross") or singing or sharing stories about ourselves.

Investing in the experience

give them pizza. they will build amazing things
Every event at TechSoc was a collaboration with another technical team on campus. And they're usually busy with projects but do want the publicity on campus. Every meeting we had with them. went as follows:

Why are we doing this event? What do we want to takeback from it
What does the event do? What's the best date and why?
How will the overall flow of conducting look like?
How do we market it?
What do we need (human resources and props) to run it successfully?
What are some loopholes we should consider when organizing this?
Metrics tracking and SWOT analysis
All this information would then be captured in a document - sample. This document would contain all the plan. the necessary links and people collaborating on it.

On ground. here are some values we ensured each time we conducted the event

Participant is god. If it means you're cycling with one hand and doing repeated samosa deliveries. sticking posters everywhere or ensuring that they have water - you gotta do it.
TechSoc never gives up. No matter how much things screw-up. And they did. like. all the time. Once there was an internet issue in a seminar we were streaming while a billion dollar CEO waited on the other end. But we recouped and did the damn thing
After-event work happens super fast. Everything from prizes. to score updation. to social media. website updating and everything.
Investing in the big picture

Mandakini hostel team. who made a car that did obstacle detection realtime
"Always build on top of your previous work". A lot of what we did at TechSoc compounded in on itself over time. We started with arguing and justfying INR 7000 rupee budgets for paper plane events and in 1 year got to INR 1.5 lakh AI hackathons. The way to do this was:

Update the fricking website - ensure that the overall presence of TechSoc was always up to date with everything that we had achieved so other people could review. With time. as we did more things. we became more awesome and it kept compounding with time. This helped get external attention and investment as well.
Build extensive documentation - Every document. going in. with time. created such a strong clarity and database - everything from important contacts to event documents and plans and costs and the whole thing - just mind-blowing. It helped a lot of people collaborate and introspect and evolve work with time.
Align everyone. Repeatedly - Every meeting. or party. or failure point - it was super important to just tell everyone what we stand for.
The Experience
Technical Society is a relatively growing student body and so the job is obviously hard. The place my team had to start from was how to even get 5 people to show up for an offline event when we were reeling back from the pandemic. Key points of my experience are:


the aero contingent team from our university (L to R - Akshat. Ayush. Pranit. Reddy Anna. my Alak boi. Sukriti)
It‚Äôs a fricking rollercoaster - There are events that go super well and then there are others where 0 people show up. My highs were really high and lows were equally painful. I‚Äôve wanted to quit and dump so many times but then there were equally balanced nights of euphoria and adrenaline
It‚Äôs about the team- Investing in the team‚Äôs growth during the summer following my recruitment was one of the best decisions I made. Because this strong loyal team stood while we encountered multiple hits over failed early events in the first semester. And now I see the same shy-to-even-turn-on-their-video-camera students stay up 14 straight hours. jugaading food and leading the conduction of tech events on campus.
Diplomacy is everything - I‚Äôve had to be nice in multiple f-you conversations and taken a lot of sit from multiple participants and stakeholders at a lot of points. Being rational more than emotional. knowing the right words to pitch to the right decision maker for an approval. collaborating with other student bodies for mutual vision alignment - that kind of thing
The tech community has heart - Tech-community is introverted. reserved and fit the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù description (barring a few outliers). But these are the same people who will pour their heart out for finessing a project - right from scribbling on whiteboards to presenting products. stand by and help each other for free. bond over late night tea conversations and pizzas. fight when they‚Äôre sleep deprived and drive real impact to push the society forward. This inspirational set of people is worth fighting for
The Growth
Gigantic network - This is the most golden essence of being in an technology college. I reached out far and wide:

interacted and connected with the most passionate tech enthusiasts across all domains at my university
connected to nationwide college's top talent through a joint Tech board
became part of a top class university entrepreneur community
multiple companies (GitHub. Unacademy) that sponsored our events
Being a better planner - Every TechSoc event had to be granularly figured out - right from the why. to the domain. to the logistics (approvals. finances. food). marketing plans. grading patterns. feedback loop and process documentation. And prior to that - figuring out which initiatives to run for which target audience and how that tied into the TechSoc vision to provide something to students that they were missing out on.

TechSoc taught me about this more than anything. You have to be a better planner than you ever were when you‚Äôre handling over 5 Lakhs of budget and getting around 30-40 things right in stressful weeks.

Becoming a stronger person - A leader is looked up to be a responsible and strong person. But no one is born that way. You learn by getting hit with a brick in the face. I learnt to be resilient. have more patience. lose the fear of crowd handling. stand my ground in hard negotations. take in a lot of negative feedback and deal with some failures. There were a lot of times when I felt like running away from the problem but the beauty of this PoR is that it won‚Äôt let you. Even when you‚Äôre tired. or tied by administration or resource constrained and super close to giving up. It has definitely increased my self-confidence to stand up to any problem in the world with a - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre TechSoc. we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù attitude.

Being part of something bigger - I had a chance to stand for a strong tech culture at my college - even though it sometimes meant being unhealthily altruistic. Looking back. I‚Äôll have not regretted that I spent my last year complaining about not having a strong tech scene at univer. I‚Äôll carry with me the legacy of having led highly passionate believers who wanted to push the limits of what technology can be.

The De-merits

passing out after 40hrs on non stop competition work and logistics
Constantly stressed - In the early days. especially with the offline shift and even during the competitions. I felt responsible for too many things. It‚Äôs an unprecedented level of stress - that no one should rationally take. Passion might be good reason to do it. but not otherwise. You‚Äôre worried for an event. a team member‚Äôs growth. someone resigning. some plan getting delayed and simultaneously 0 participation in another event on the next day. Since the team is small. unlike other bodies. you‚Äôre involved personally in most things and while the growth is good - the cost it comes at. is also high
Personal sacrifices - Barely any time on most weekends. I remember just bouncing across meetings post 8pm on a lot of weekdays and then standing by the team. I‚Äôve missed a lot of social life. sometimes even personal goals (heck. I didn‚Äôt work on my startup during national competitions) and relaxing. as I struggled to move the needles of 3 different verticals whilst the cores were still warming up. The role does take a lot out of you and it‚Äôs not a good thing always.
A lot of ground-work - My leadership style has always been more hands-on. Might be a good or bad thing. I don‚Äôt know the balance. There are days when people won‚Äôt work upto your standards and you‚Äôll have to step in and help even though you really are just mad and might want to panic and yell at them to get it done. Compassion taught me to share the load - right from being a TShirt distributor to a sweeper to poster designer to food delivery agent.
A crazy story
I'll tell a story of how I learnt persistence. In 2023. I was leading a 90 member contingent from our university to participate in Inter IIT Tech Meet (a national level competition for solving technical challenges). I was managing 15 projects over 2 months and was also in charge of the logistics. travel and accommodation in Kanpur. I booked the train tickets for my contingent through our institute and they assured us of tickets to Kanpur. However. in on the day of travel. amidst 100+ things I juggled all the way upto the train station. I realized that our tickets from Chennai to Kanpur were waitlisted. The train was full and keeping in mind the safety of my team. I told them to get off and said we'd find another way. And so. this story begins with a huge group ¬†of people. staring down at me at 12am on a railway station. with hopes that I'd get them to our competition - 2000 miles away - in the next 36 hours.

I arranged for a bus back to the campus and stayed up till 3. trying to figure out how I'd get my team to Kanpur safely. with the limited budget I had. For context. our institute had a no-flight refund policy for competitions. We brainstormed multiple routes via permutations of bus and train but we'd reach late and fatigued. At 3:15am. Shreepoorna found a reasonable flight ticket deal from Chennai to Delhi. At 3:30am. I poured in all my personal savings of about INR 85000 (with a INR 10000 loan) and booked the tickets to Kanpur. Here's the celebration video of that too.


the moment the tickets for kanpur were booked at 3:30am (gut feeling- all these people are going to make great founders 1 day)
Next. I spent 2 hours breaking it to the 2 people. whose tickets couldn't be booked due to limited funds. At 4am. I was standing at Cauvery Hostel. getting rattled by a junior on how I'd failed my entire purpose as a leader. Returning to my room in a mess. I wrote a long email to the Dean. explaining the situtation before I passed out.

After a 1 hr nap. I woke up in cold sweats. informing our Dean with a long email - the entire situation. 9am. I showed up to their office. shaking. But the admin rallied with us and with their support. got the tickets for the remaining team as well.

After 2 hours we flew to Delhi. In-flight. I worked with the people solving the "entrepreneurship challenge" and got their submission right. Abhishek Gupta (on campus) was making the pitch deck all the way to 12 when we submitted it. before we finally got kicked out of the cafe we made our makeshift office. with just a single coffee order. Next. at Delhi. we haggled and arranged bus transport to Kanpur for all with a 40% discount. Turns out. back then. online bookings weren't considered valid and you had to physically haggle and get people in the bus.

Fun fact. we got screwed over by the bus guys who dropped us about 25km away and once again. stranded on a highway at 7am. our team is bargaining with auto drivers to get us there.

Finally. after the entire long journey. we reached Kanpur campus 10 hours before time. 24 hours after that. with a parched throat. I pitched and won the silver medal for my college at the entrepreneurship challenge. Oh and the savings I put in? I got them reimbursed a month later by tweaking around my cloud provider SaaS costs and showing AWS credits as expenditure (technically. I did lose the money).

This is my favourite story that I like to share as I can neither put it in my resume nor will it be a conventional interview question - but it is so fundamental to my way of working - Persistence. I'd rather sweat in a garage than recline in a cabin. Cause where other's see unconvention. I see genius. "Ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. are the ones who really do"

Here's another story blog I wrote about an initiative TechSoc created and ran - to motivate students to believe and build projects - link

Coolest things I got to do

Okay so this post is not actually about college ragging but majorly about Retrieval Generated Augmentation (RAG). a cool machine learning and indexing application I came across while building CloudPilot - "the copilot for cloud engineers"

What is CloudPilot? ‚úàÔ∏è
CloudPilot was a project we built with the vision of going from idea to cloud within 10 minutes.

The goal of the project was to enable any thinker to start with a business problem. quickly to research and come up with a wholesome engineering document that had the solution approach. its architecture and performance analysis done well in under 10 minutes.

This product was built at a hackathon in under 24 hours. Let me know if there are any improvements you want me to look at.

And with that. let's dive in. into the product flow



What does a cloud engineer do?
First. let's understand how cloud architects function and come up with infrastructure solutions for a given business problem. See. as a typical cloud architect - the flow is as follows

Step 0: - It starts with a problem statement such as a architecture for payment gateway or a data migration pipeline or a high availability server fleet setup.
Step 1: Ask the right questions - Several times. we go back and forth with the problem statement to understand what are the exact business requirements and what are important aspects that we need to optimize for.
Step 2: Research - With the given requirements. the standard approach is to go online. read up some blogs by cloud providers. read case studies and open source articles to get context and understand our problem statement. Here. typically a lot of time is just spent in finding the right article. Most software problems have precedents that have solved the requirement wholly or in parts. Hence. finding the right documentation for similar requirements is of paramount importance.
Step 3: Technical Requirements - Once we have asked the right questions. we prepare a brief technical document. highlighting the most important performance expectations from the software and then start researching what kind of cloud offerings do we require. We also quantify that to what extent do we want to look at satisfying a particular goal. eg: 500 TB of storage. 80ms latency in communication. 7 0s of availability. 8GB GPUs for ML training.
Step 4: List the building blocks - Here. we simply map each techinal requirement to an existing cloud service we can use and do a comparative analysis. If it's ML. it's gotta be Google Cloud. for availability and cost. it's gotta be AWS - that kinda thing. So we start listing cloud offerings such as EC2 (AWS). Maps API (Google Cloud) or Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Azure). We think of using these offerings as builing blocks for the entire architecture and justify why the offering is important
Step 5: Join the blocks - Here. we join together the building blocks as services that communicate with 1 another and draw a systems diagram that helps to understand how the overall system works. Which part does what function and how it's role fits into the overall requirement.
Step 6: Iterate - Once an end-to-end flow is ready. we do overall Product. Engineering and Cost Analysis and then we iterate upon the design to optimize for certain aspects - make it faster. make it cheaper. increase the storage. increase the redundancy - that kind of thing. And based on that. we improve the choice of building blocks and integrating them together in 1 system
Step 7: Templatize - Once a cloud architecture is ready. we start looking at using Cloud templates such as CloudFormation by AWS. Terraform by Hashicorp to easily just deploy the entire architecture and have a skeleton of it functional to understand performance on a practical level.
Thus. this is the overall flow of the entirety of coming up with a cloud architecture. Beautiful and methodical.

So if we were to copilotize this process we would need an AI agent who could read through all cloud architecture related blogs. docs. case-studies like an engineer and intuitively go through steps 1 to 8 and help arrive upon a solution.

And that's why we used something called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique where we retrieved the right list of documents from the internet and asked our Large Language Model to generate an answer from text that it studied from these docs.

Before we segway into what we did. let's study in short - what is this "Retrieval Augmented Generation" anyways?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)


Imagine you're a chef and you're trying to create a new dish. First. you go to your pantry (which has a vast array of ingredients). This is akin to the retrieval part. You take a look at different recipes you have used in the past or a recipe book for ideas. You fetch or 'retrieve' ingredients and inspiration based on these recipes.

Next. you start to combine these ingredients together. perhaps in a way you've never done before. You might modify some of the recipes to match your taste or to make the dish unique. This is similar to the 'generation' part of the process.

Now. let's say you have some guests coming over and you know their preferences. To accommodate them. you decide to modify your new dish even further or add some garnish to make it look more appealing. This is comparable to the 'augmentation' part. where you make some tweaks to make the final result better suited for its purpose.

Bringing it back to the context of AI and natural language processing. Retrieval-Generated Augmentation is a method where you:

'Retrieve' relevant data or content from a large dataset (like a chef searching through the pantry or recipe books).
'Generate' new data or content based on this retrieved data (like a chef creating a new dish using the fetched ingredients). and then
'Augment' this generated content. usually by making some modifications to better suit the task at hand (like a chef adjusting the dish to suit the guests' taste).
This method is very useful for tasks that involve generating text or other types of data. especially when you want to produce content that is tailored for a specific task. purpose. or audience.

It's also a way to improve the performance of machine learning models. by providing them with a richer. more varied dataset to learn from. The richer and more varied the 'ingredients' (i.e.. the data). the better the 'dish' (i.e.. the model's output) can potentially be.



How we built the damn thing
Part 1: "Retrieve"
For this we would leverage the open-source documents. blogs. systems diagrams and articles by major Cloud Providers such as AWS. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

We created a custom index of just these documents. Using Amazon Kendra. we indexed over 192000 such information webpages using its web-connector. Here. the major difficulty we faced was understanding which XML sitemaps did we have to index and how. Some documents were in Japanese and some were just plain irrelevant marketing content. So intelligent document structure filtering was required at this level to index the right documents for our search.

Thus. this helped us to get the best documents to pull in for a given query. For example the queries below.




Using Kendra for getting top documents for a given search query
Part 2: "Generate"
Alright so you've got the top 10 documents you're supposed to refer to. But how can we improve the experience of gleaning valuable insights for your given business problem? That's where we use the superpower of an LLM. It's like asking it to read all documents and answer over it

So. once we "retrieve" the documents from Amaz√∏n Kendra. we ask the LLM to take the top 5 most relevant documents. pass all the text in them as tokens to the LLM (number of tokens varies depending on the LLM. we used GPT-4 by OpenAI that takes in upto 8000 tokens). The LLM parses the text and via few-shot learning over the context of business problem and the documents from Kendra. "generates" a response for the end user.

This is the simple task. Get the relevant docs and then generate a textual response from the same. Let's improve the experience now.



Part 3: The end-to-end architecture
Stringing together this in an entire experience involved developing the following flow.

Get the input prompt for the business requirement from the user and generate a set of relevant questions about the business to ask the user. For this we used an LLM


We recorded the question answers and the business requirement. did some text summarization and trimming (using nltk to remove whitespaces. punctuations etc.) and then we pass it all as a cumulative context for searching best documents in Amazon Kendra

Next. we get the best docuements from Amazon Kendra as text. combine that with business prompt and QnA and pass it to our LLM for giving a textual response

Once we get the response. we return that. along with hyperlinks to the documents that Kendra returned so the user can get our summarized.structured answer as well as refer the source documents for more information at their own leisure

To help the cloud engineer with more specific information. we added a feature to generate the following from the textual answer
6. Systems diagram for the architecture proposed to understand how to link together the building blocks
7. IaaC code template - Basically a CloudFormation code template to quickly just spin up the architecture and study its performance and behavior in cloud
8. Cost estimation - based on information that the LLM has been trained on. using AWS pricing docs as data source

Lastly. we provided a chat interface for the user to keep passing more requirements (such as "make it cheaper?". "make the system faster?") to the service. Now. we pass a combination of these 4 things to the LLM to get an improved answer = original business prompt + QnA + generated answer + additional user request



What can we improve upon?
Here's the current complete system that was built:



Okay so this project was awesomely exciting but the main complaint I have from it is that it is too slow. It still takes 2 minutes to generate answers and diagrams. A way to improve that would be some compute on frontend or some level of caching

Also. the answers are still generic and unless the prompt is well-engineered. we wouldn't discover novel architectures and solutions. So. that's something we need to fine-tune for. Maybe some sort of a framework for the user to engineer their prompt even better. Asking better technical requirement questions for a given business prompt could be a good starting point.

Lastly. it's expensive. Kendra is expensive and so is using OpenAI. So the approach for solving this is - open-source it! A search index with Elasticsearch combined with a custom LLM such as the Llama. Lima and Flan-T5 models can help cut down on costs

Oooh. a cool feature could have also using voice to speech and language translation (with using localized cloud services docs) to provide multilingual support to our beloved copilot

In closing....
We're having a copilot for pretty much everything these days ever since the Generative AI hype cycle started so I just thought of creating something that could help engineers to better adopt the Cloud Services by any cloud and help leverage them in the best possible way

Here are some useful reference links:

I'd rather sweat in a garage then recline in a cabin
The story for this starts with wanting to figure out how a student can get from point A in skillset to point B in skillset (their desired ambition) - given an educational ecosystem that provides certain opportunities. And we did realize it. atleast for 3000+ students in my undergraduate college.

I ran Coursepanel for a year and we built several cool things in this journey. I'll keep this blog fairly technical but also throw in certain snippets about entrepreneurship and lessons learnt along the way. Most of this blog is going to be about the technical implementation of this project. I have mentioned my learnings as an entrepreneur in the end.

To read the story of the early days and launch. checkout - here


Technical Deep-dive
Understanding Natural Language Processing and Vector Embeddings
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science. artificial intelligence. and linguistics. It involves programming computers to effectively process large amounts of natural language data. As part of NLP. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. developed by OpenAI. are designed to generate human-like text based on the inputs they receive. They are trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate contextually relevant text.

However. they do not know specific documents or sources they were trained on and don't have the capability to access or retrieve specific documents or databases during the generation process. Their strength lies in understanding and generating text that closely resembles human-like responses. thus forming a key part of systems like CourseGPT.

Vector embeddings are another crucial component of such systems. In the realm of machine learning. embeddings are a way to convert categorical variables into continuous vectors so as to feed them into a model. They can be used to capture the semantics of words in a language. relationships between items. and even user behavior in an application.


Basic demo of how words are converted into vector embeddings (source)

These embeddings. when stored in a vector database. form the basis of effective search and recommendation systems.

Building a vector database using a knowledge graph
For the purpose of this project. based on the previous training data. we turned our knowledge graph (aka ‚Äúskillmap‚Äù) into a vector database for storing entries and answering queries related to academic data. This was done in 4 steps:

Creating a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j: The first step involved modeling our data as a graph and storing it in Neo4j. Our nodes represent entities such as NPTEL courses. books. departments. etc.. and relationships represented the connections between these entities
Generating Vector Embeddings: The next step involved generating vector embeddings from our graph. These embeddings are a form of representation that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of your data in the form of vectors in a high-dimensional space. There are several techniques to generate graph embeddings. like Node2Vec. GraphSAGE. etc. This project used the Node2Vec library in Python to achieve the same. We ran Node2Vec algorithms on our Neo4j graph to generate node and relationship embeddings.
Store Vector Embeddings: The generated embeddings then needed to be stored for future use. Typically. we‚Äôd want a database that is optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. You could use a vector database like Pinecone. Faiss. or even Elasticsearch with a vector plugin for this purpose.
Querying the Vector Database: The final part involved using these vector embeddings to make our application smarter. For example. we could now perform operations like semantic search. recommendations. or similarity checks by comparing vectors. This involved querying our vector database for the nearest vectors to a given input vector. which gave us the most semantically similar entities to our query.
Scoping NPTEL data into the Vector Database and building a chatbot
To create a system like CourseGPT. we first need to load the relevant data into the vector database. Let's assume we have course data from NPTEL in a CSV format. This data can be processed and converted into vector embeddings using various techniques like Word2Vec. GloVe. or even using transformers-based models. These vector representations can then be loaded into the vector database. which allows us to perform efficient similarity search operations.

The vector database enables us to compare the query vector (which can be a representation of a user's query or a specific course interest) with all vectors in our database. and retrieves the most similar entries. These entries represent courses that are most relevant to the user's query.

Once the entries are returned. we need to translate these course vectors back into a human-readable form. This is where LLMs like GPT-3 come into play. These models can generate contextually relevant. human-like text based on the returned entries. The generated text can be as simple as a course name and description. or as complex as a detailed career path recommendation.

In this way. the synergy of NLP. LLMs. and vector databases leads to the development of an effective system like CourseGPT. Such a system can revolutionize the way we approach professional upskilling and corporate training by providing personalized. contextual. and interactive learning experiences.

The journey in a nutshell
The development and evolution of CourseGPT. spread over a 12-month period. could've been a significant step forward in the application of advanced technologies such as AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP). and Knowledge Graphs to the critical area of professional upskilling and corporate training.

The journey began with understanding the problem domain. setting the objectives and scope. and constructing the methodology flowchart. The decision to pick a test sandbox environment of similar nature proved instrumental in aligning the development of CourseGPT closely with the real-world challenges encountered in professional learning and development.

Deep dives into models of corporate training. specifically the Kirkpatrick Model. provided insights into the metrics for successful training outcomes. Skill mapping using a knowledge graph emerged as a novel and efficient approach to resolving course recommendations and facilitating an effective learning journey for the students.

Working with the NPTEL team and building a skill map for IIT Madras underscored the potential of this tool in academic environments as well. Implementing Natural Entity Recognition and NLP allowed us to extract valuable course tags and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Moreover. the research conducted at HyperVerge Academy (HVA) enabled a deeper understanding of the professional upskilling space. Facing and overcoming various challenges along the way. we succeeded in developing a competency engine and data model that significantly enriched the capabilities of CourseGPT.

Finally. CourseGPT emerged as an intelligent product. leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to recommend courses based on career goals. plan academic journeys. solve student doubts. and inclusively cater to diverse learners. The journey. although filled with complexities and challenges. offered valuable insights into the future of AI-enabled learning and set a foundation for ongoing research and development.

Here's the various launch videos of products that I built. just as a nostalgic flash from the past.





Why I failed to run it as a company.
With Coursepanel. we made around 35000 INR in revenue with 3000+ free users and then got stuck in a loop of developing without continuous customer interaction. I shut down Coursepanel in May 2023. I was embarassed. mentally disturbed and self-doubting when I did it. It was hard and it was like I had given up on a dream ¬†and failed myself. But picking up and moving on is the way forward. Here are a few things I learnt from this experience - these aren't novel learnings - these are the same fuckups most startup folks advise against but I did it anyway and learnt it again - at a heavy price:

Don't do it alone. It's not that I'm doubting individual capability - it's just that context switching has a very difficult toll when you ¬†want strong velocity in both business and innovaiton. Also there's the emotional burden of doing it alone. Worst case. atleast have a friend to talk to and help sort out a lot of operations and communications
It's best to build a shitty product with continuous customer interaction but no point of siloed building. no matter what you feel about current systems. Even asking and then building then again asking then building - i.e. an intermittent month-to-month setup might not help. Atleast talk to users each week.
Make money from the start. It's the only way to stay afloat.
Don't get to emotionally attached to your innovation or amazed by exciting new things you can do. Focus on the minimum that gets you paid. get it right and then expand with bolder experiments.
It's boring and requires discipline and routine to continuously outperform other teams. You have to consistently just keep pushing. Motivation is 2/3rds of this game.

So yeah. I guess that's about it. I was very passionate. worked very hard and was heartbroken - but I guess I'm carrying forward a lot - something that classroom would have never taught me. Let's see. I'm about to do something again in the Generative AI space. This time - business first though - get the "what are people gonna pay for" right and then expand from that base thought into technical innovation and exquisite design.

Problems define markets
Having a more accurate understanding of the market in which your product is really competing
A market is not tied to any specific solutions that meet those needs. That is why you see ‚Äúmarket disruptions‚Äù: when a new type of product (solution space) better meets the market needs (problem space)
The ‚Äúwhat‚Äù describes the benefits that the product should give the customer‚Äîwhat the product will accomplish for the user or allow the user to accomplish.
The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the way in which the product delivers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to the customer. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is problem space and ‚Äúhow‚Äù is solution space.
üí°
What = problem space
How = solution space
Lean product teams articulate the hypotheses they have made and solicit customer feedback on early design ideas to test those hypotheses.

Should you listen to customers?
It‚Äôs true that customers aren‚Äôt going to lead you to the Promised Land of a break-through innovative product. but customer feedback is like a flashlight in the night: it keeps you from falling off a cliff as you try to find your way there.

Using the solution space to discover the problem space
Hard for customers to talk about abstract benefits and the relative importance of each‚Äîand when they do. it‚Äôs often fraught with inaccuracies
This can be solved by techniques like "contextual inquiry" or "customer discovery"
The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. If you show them a new product or design. they can tell you what they like and don‚Äôt like. They can compare it to other solutions and identify pros and cons.
The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created
Divergent and convergent thinking
You should be practicing divergent thinking. which means trying to generate as many ideas as possible without any judgment or evalua-tion. There will be plenty of time later for convergent thinking. where you evaluate the ideas and decide which ones you think are the most promising.

you want to capture all the ideas that your team generated. then organize them by the benefit that they deliver.
Then. for each benefit. you want to review and prioritize the list of feature ideas.
You can score each idea on expected customer value to determine a first-pass priority.
The goal is to identify the top three to five features for each benefit.
There is not much value in looking beyond those top features right now because things will change‚Äîa lot‚Äîafter you show your prototype to customers.
A user story is a brief description of the benefit that the particular functionality should provide. including whom the benefit is for (the target customer). and why the customer wants the benefit.

üí°
As a [type of user]. I want to [do something]. so that I can [desired benefit].
¬†eg : As a professional photographer.I want to easily upload pictures from my camera to my website.so that I can quickly show my clients their pictures. ¬†

üí°
INVEST framework
I - independent of other stories
N - not explicit and must be flexible. open for discussion
V - valuable to customer
E - reasonlaby estimate scope
S - small
T - testable
¬†

Small tickets and smaller ticket batch sizes are better
Break tickets into atomic chunks. Trim extra stuff
The batch size is the number of products worked on together at the same time in parallel. Faster velocity of small batches -> faster feedback -> reduce risk and waste
The longer you work on a product with-out getting customer feedback. the more you risk a major disconnect that subsequently requires significant rework.
Scoping with story points
Story points - type of currency for estimating relative ticket size
Have a max threshold for story points
Good operating principle ¬†- break down stories with high points into smaller stories
Return on investment to prioritize
When you are building a product or feature. the investment is usually the time that your development resources spend working on it. which you generally measure in units such as developer-weeks (one developer working for one week).
It‚Äôs true that you could probably calculate an equivalent dollar amount. but people use units like developer-weeks because they are simpler and clearer
Visualizing ROI

Good product teams strive to come up with ideas like idea G in Figure 6.1‚Äîthe ones that create high customer value for low effort.
Great product teams are able to take ideas like that. break them down into chunks. trim off less valuable pieces. and identify creative ways to deliver the customer value with less effort than initially scoped‚Äîindicated in the figure by moving idea G to the left.
The accuracy of the estimates should be proportional to the fidelity of the product definition
The main point of these calculations is less about figuring out actual ROI values and more about how they compare to each other
¬†

Approximating ROI and Deciding on MVP candidate

Just comparing feature importance wrt one another. Once that‚Äôs done. arrange all features in this format as per benefit categories


Intentionally give them generic names so that you can more easily envision replacing them with what would be relevant for your product. ‚ÄúM1A‚Äù means feature chunk A for must-have 1. ‚ÄúP2B‚Äù means feature chunk B for perfor-mance benefit 2. and ‚ÄúD2C‚Äù means feature chunk C for delighter benefit 21.
Decide on the MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONALITY that will resonate with TG users
Look down the leftmost column of feature chunks and determine which ones you think need to be in your MVP candidate. While doing so. you should refer to your product value proposition
After this. focus on the main performance benefit you‚Äôre planning to use to beat the competition
Delighters are part of your differentiation. too. You should include your top delighter in your MVP candidate.
So if you‚Äôve made tentative plans beyond your MVP. you must be prepared to throw them out the window and come up with new plans based on what you learn from customers.

Moving on to MVP and early Prototyping
Use the broad term MVP ‚Äúprototype‚Äù to capture the wide range of items you can test with cus-tomers to gain learning. While the first ‚Äúprototype‚Äù you test could be your live MVP. you can gain faster learning with fewer resources by testing your hypotheses before you build your MVP.

What is/isn't an MVP?

There has been spirited debate over what qualifies as an MVP. Some people argue vehemently that a landing page is a valid MVP. Others say it isn‚Äôt. insisting that an MVP must be a real. working product or at least an interactive prototype.
The way I resolve this dichotomy is to realize that these are all methods to test the hypotheses behind your MVP. By using the term ‚ÄúMVP tests‚Äù instead of MVP. the debate goes away
Product vs Marketing MVP Tests

Marketing test - You‚Äôre simply describing the functionality to prospective customers to see how compelling they find your description
MVP Tests - validate your product will involve showing prospective customers functionality to solicit their feedback on it. You may be showing them a live beta product or just low fidelity wireframes to assess product-market fit
Marketing tests can provide valuable learning. but they‚Äôre not an actual product that creates customer value. At some point. you need to test a prototype of your MVP candidate
Quantitative vs Qualitative MVP Tests

Qualitative - you are talking with customers directly. usually in small numbers that don‚Äôt yield statistical significance eg: If. for example. you conducted one-on-one feedback sessions with 12 prospective customers to solicit their feedback on a mockup of your landing page. then that would be qualitative research

Quantitative - conducting the test at scale with alarge number of customers. ¬†You don‚Äôt care as much about any indi-vidual result and are instead interested in the aggregate results.

eg: If you launched two versions of your landing page and directed thousands of customers to each one to see which one had the higher conversion rate. then that would be a quantitative test.

Quant = what. how; Qual = why

Quantitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many‚Äù: what actions customers took and how many customers took an action (e.g.. clicked on the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button). But quantitative tests will not tell you why they chose to do so or why the other customers chose not to do so. In contrast. qualitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: the reasons behind different customers‚Äô decisions to take an action or not.

If you don't know where you're going. you might not get there
Objective Key-Result (OKR) is a framework of approaching a goal/project that ensures that you and your team make 1000s of decisions and steps. while being aligned on a common vision.

This blog will largely explore the key learnings I've gathered from this awesome book on the topic called "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. If you're curious. this person learnt the OKR framework from top management at Intel and replicated successfully. the same principles - at Google and grew the young startup at breakneck speed with people and products - whilst retaining the core vision of making information easily accessible to all.

The very 1st slide John showed to team Google said OKRS: "A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization"

I'll litter this blog with excerpts and stories that the book explored and I found most helpful.

OKR short intro
Objective is the WHAT is to bo achieved. These are significant. concrete. action oriented and ideally inspirational.

Key Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound. aggressive yet reliastic. Most of all they're measurable and reliable.

Where an objective can be long-lived. rolled over for a year or longer. key results evolve as the work progresses. Once the KRs are completed -> the objective is achieved

Thus. OKRs channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse ops. lending purpose and unity to the entire org. This is supremely important at startups or young companies where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction

The maker of OKR
Andy Grove. an Intel exec is credited for having created the management system of OKRs when Intel had taken up the responsibility of Operation Crush - a race to win in the 16-bit microprocessor market with their 8086 product in a time where cheaper and less performant products were eating market share.

It was the glorious story of how Intel dumped the business of memory-chip and went all-in on microprocessors and completely "crushed" every other contemporary compute company.

Here. are the 1st tenets of this system. by Dr. Grove himself:

Less is more
Set goals from the bottom up
No dictating
Stay flexible
Dare to fail

Great companies take the surplus cash flows created by their sustainable competitive advantages and then either return those to shareholders or reinvest those in their core franchise or - and this is the litmus test of greatness - reinvest those successfully in new activities or markets
"Unusual Billionaires". by Saurabh Mukherjea. is an unusually riveting & practical thesis. It is a collection of stories of brilliant companies that made their dent in the world by continuously innovating. providing great service. and building powerful teams & stable assets. It teaches us the unconventional yet core fundamental process of sustainably building great companies amidst this era of venture-backed rocketship dreams.

In this blog I'll be listing snippets from the book. that teach us all. the values of how great companies our built and share my thoughts on the same. ¬†In this market of the recession of fly-high crashes of crypto exchanges. the gloom of overpowering AI agents & plummeting stock prices. I think we can all take a page out of these learnings & realize how lasting services are created.

Asian paints
Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness. it turns out. is largely a matter of conscious choice. ~ Jim Collins (Good to great)
An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire ~ Yuval Nova Harari
A great company attracts the best talent. commands respect in the business community and. more often than not. trades at a premium in the stock market
Greatness is meant to be an enduring quality. Stock prices are an effect and not a cause of a company‚Äôs greatness
Metrics in a great company
Revenue growth of 10% and ROCE of 15% every year for non-financial services companies
Loan book growth of 15% and ROE of 15% every year for financial services companies
‚ÄúWe have consciously stuck to a sector which is growing and offers decent potential and have always strived for excellence across all functional areas. But it is not because somebody is observing us and is going to applaud us. We have just stuck to our knitting sensibly as the sector has evolved over decades - Jalaj Dani (promoter)
By obsessively using tech and talent to improve on internal processes and efficiencies. these companies put considerable distance between themselves and the competitions. In particular. this focus on efficiency and cost reduction helps the champion companies sustain high levels of profitability in a way that most of their rivals simply can‚Äôt match
Create and nurture an environment in which a multitude of talented minds work in harmony so that mutual competence is reinforcing rather than debilitating
IBAS framework - Innovation. Brands & rep. architecture. strategic assets
Innovation - shopkeeper would get 3.5% extra discount. if. without fail. he made payments on time throughout the year. adoption of computers & GPS
Brands & rep - Asian Paints changed their messaging to maintain an emotional connection with their target audience. Thus came the brand ambassador of a mischievous kid with a can of paint (name - ‚ÄúGattu‚Äù)
Architecture - Creating a truly independent board of directors to help shape evolution of the firm. Rapid career progression for those who perform with job rotation at reg. intervals.
Empowerment allows creativity. It‚Äôs about the feeling of being a family - Jalaj Dani
Strategic assets - sources of competitive advantages - intellectual property. licences. regulatory permissions. access to natural resources and natural monopolies
On the trust Asian paints built - ‚Äú50% of dealers won‚Äôt check their accounts. despite having access to a web portal which gives them real time updates on their accounts‚Äù

The most difficult thing to change at a company is to change its people

Don‚Äôt recruit someone who is not able to do a job. just to fill a vacancy. Secondly. even if we don‚Äôt have a job. but you come across the right person. you must recruit him

In FY13. talent and skill are increasingly becoming scarce and it requires considerable effort to identify. engage and retain such talents. The report also added that salary alone is not the criteria for satisfaction of deserving employees and that the firm needs to offer a participative work environment and an open culture

Marico
I strongly believe that culture can be a source of competitive advantage in an org and it is impossible to copy. The org‚Äôs culture is a major driving force in the execution of strategy. Correct culture helps in proper execution of strategy by helping everyone align on the same page (Mariwala)
A promoter supporting and listening to the board. although being a 60 percent shareholder. makes indep directors feel proud because we think that we are able to contribute to Marico. These things don‚Äôt reflect directly on the balance sheet. P&L or share price. but these are inputs which go into creation of long-term shareholder wealth
Page
Many companies justify risking balance sheet & profits for fueling growth. However. Page has maintained steadfast financial discipline whilst expanding its operations and at the same time. its share prices have also kept up an upward trend
‚ÄòOur managers understand that it‚Äôs not about having power but about how you empower your subordinates & bring about the best results from your team members. Hence each member behaves like a leader and that gives us a winning culture - Sunder Genomal
‚ÄòFrom day one. Mr Genomal has pushed us into adopting a process-oriented approach. Almost everything we do at Page is part of an Excel sheet.
‚ÄòWe want to keep our distributors‚Äô balance sheets healthy because our business is dependent on their finances. If they have the wrong inventory stuck with them. it neither helps us nor them
Even the core projects will not be taken up unless they promise an ROCE of atleast 20%

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in a commodity business. the only way to thrive is to be a low-cost producer. And when you‚Äôre selling money. you‚Äôre in a commodity business - Duff McDonald
Shikha Sharma - I advise other companies‚Äô CEOs not to fall into the trap where you go - Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth - They feel a tremendous pressure to grow. Well. sometimes you can‚Äôt grow. Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to grow. In certain businesses. growth means you either take on bad clients. excess risk or too much leverage - Jamie Dimon (CEO of JPMC)
The shift from people to processes was critical as the bank was moving away from reliance on corporate banking to retail banking (which needs very high use of data & analytics based decision making to grow the business whilst maintaining commercial viability
This operating structure makes the CEO of a pvt bank both less powerful than a promoter of a non-bank company but more influential than the CEO of a non-bank company (pg 209)
Employee policies are very consistent at Axis Bank and there is little ambiguity and subjectivity in the pay hikes and bonuses. All supervisors have to clearly explain the ratings they assign to their subordinates - something that decides pay rise. promotion & bonus. You won‚Äôt find this in other pvt sector banks. where a lot of randomness prevails in salary hikes. bonuses & promotions where lower rated employees have got higher bonuses
HDFC bank
Building a visionary company requires 1% vision & 99% alignment - Jim Collins
An org‚Äôs ability to learn & translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive advantage - Jack Welch
HDFC Bank‚Äôs strength rests not so much on the uniqueness of tech it uses but in the way that tech is lined up in a clever process flow i.e. not envisaged by other banks.
Strong focus on systems & procedures meant that the people who succeeded them did not find it difficult to take over responsibilities quickly

What makes a great company:
Theme A - Focus on the long term (more than ten years) without being distracted by short-term gambles
Theme B - Constantly deepen the moat around the core franchise using the IBAS framework
Theme C - Sensibly allocate capital whilst studiously avoiding betting the balance sheet on expensive and unrelated forays
Ability to steadfastly focus on doing the same thing for decades on end whilst gradually strengthening their franchise. generating surplus cash from that endeavour and then giving much of that back to shareholders whilst reinvesting the rest judiciously
Ram Charan - Leaders who say ‚ÄúI have got ten priorities‚Äù don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about
Jim Collins(Great by Choice. 2011) - 20 Mile March requires hitting specified performance markers with great consistency over a long period of time. It requires 2 distinct types of discomfort. delivering high performance in difficult times and holding back in good times
Good management teams work on proving a concept before investing a lot of capital. They are not likely to put a lot of money in all at once. hoping for a big payoff - Michael Shearn
Firstly. diversifications if any. are consciously restrained. instead of breaking or stretching the balance sheet. Secondly. surplus cash. when available. is returned to shareholders when in can‚Äôt be effectively deployed without dragging the ROCE down sharply. Whilst all of this might sound straightforward. these axioms are rarely implemented by Indian promoters who all too often treat their listed companies as their personal fiefdoms and short-change the minority shareholders
A company‚Äôs profitability increases as it moves up the value addition chain
Competitive advantage - if value added is the difference between the cost of a company‚Äôs inputs and that of its output. then competitive advantage allows a company to add more value than its rivals. Furthermore. a sustainable competitive advantage enables a company to continue sustaining this extra value addition over long periods of time
Unless innovation becomes a process which a firm lives day in and day out. the firm will appear impressive initially. and then ultimately disappoint. A product can be quickly outdated. but a successful brand is timeless

What is Back of the envelope?
A Back of the envelope calculation is a simple arithmetic operation frequently carried out on a little piece of paper. like an envelope. Back of the envelope analysis quickly generates a ballpark figure using approximated or rounded figures. An estimate is more accurate than a wild guess but less exact than a formal calculation using precise numbers in a spreadsheet or other program. These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.

In honor of physicist Enrico Fermi. back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.

In this article. we will talk about this methodology's history. applications. and best practices. Furthermore. I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations. Just a disclaimer - the calculations that are about to be added. are made with heavy assumptions - looking at Twitter 2.0 as a new service that we‚Äôll be building & basic components required for the same. The calculations don‚Äôt involve considerations of economies of scale. redundancy. replication and most estimations that involve scaling. We are just understanding a basic implementation of storage for the app. for the scale it is it


Twitter 2.0‚Äôs System Design diagram shared by Elon Musk in November 2022 - Source

Why are back of the envelope calculations needed?
The calculation generally informs us if the design can satisfy the functional requirements. such as the number of supported users. response latency. and resource needs. For instance. when deciding between different architectural designs. the simplest question to ask is whether one server is enough. To get a ballpark figure. we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require. if not one.

Notable Industry Applications
Some of the use cases where back of the envelope calculation has been used:

An important Internet protocol. the Border Gateway Protocol. was sketcBeforein 1989 by engineers on the back of "three ketchup-stained napkins". and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.
UTF-8. the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.
The Bailey bridge is a type of portable. pre-fabricated. truss bridge and was extensively used by British. Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.
The Laffer Curve. which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income. was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.
We've looked at some of the important historical applications of the back of the envelope. now we'll examine the arithmetic process to see how we can utilise it to solve our own issues. This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.

Getting Started with Back of the Envelope
Whenever we try to learn something new. we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly. when beginning system design estimations. we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers. used for estimating the speed of a system. are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency. as a term. helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example. the latency of the best video chat applications. such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.

How can we implement this?
Before approximating the real utilization. we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance. we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.

How can we guess the real usage?

The utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and. if necessary. further divided) and combined.

For instance. we might anticipate 1K active users. each of whom submits 15 requests daily.

15K requests per day. or 15K/86400 requests per second. are involved.

An effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly. Nobody likes to multiply by 86400. To give 0.2 seconds to serve a single request. let's round to 20K/100K. We need to set up at least 4 computers if we know that it takes 0.7 seconds to serve one request. Of course. you don't want to live on the edge. so let's increase the number of machines by a buffer and make it ten.

How to calculate quickly
If someone asked you to calculate: 2456000 x 4598; that would slow things down. wouldn‚Äôt it?

The simpler way to calculate quickly would be instead of spelling down a whole number. use small numbers paired with an abbreviation for magnitude (or. if necessary. exponents). 1K as opposed to 1000.

When given a huge. excessively exact number. such as 7432. immediately translate it to 7K. Anyhow. you are estimating.

This format for numbers makes multiplication and division quick.

KK is M. [K is Kilo; M is Mega]

G/M is K. [G is Giga]

4K7M = 28G.

Round both of them towards a small multiple of a power of 2 or 10 to work with larger numbers.

2714 ~= 3010 = 3000.
6500/250 ~= 6400/256 ~= 100 * 2^6 / 2^8 ~= 100 / 2^2 = 25.
Where to start Back of the envelope?
List the common use-cases of the system and decide which critical resources they require. You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start. but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?

Varied use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance. serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU. whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM. Since you need to purchase machines that are maxed out on both dimensions. hosting all those services on homogeneous machines would waste CPU and RAM.

Such differences indicate those features should be split to different services. hosted on independent sets of machines.

Real-world case study - Storage Costs borne by Twitter

Source

Problem: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements
Please note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers from Twitter.

Assumptions:

300 million monthly active users.
50% of users use Twitter daily.
Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
10% of tweets contain media.
Data is stored for 5 years.
Estimations:

Query per second (QPS) estimate:

Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000
Let‚Äôs start solving
There are 2 important queries that need to be addressed for any system:

‚ÄúRequests per second‚Äù at the server level
‚ÄúQueries per second‚Äù at the database level.
Let‚Äôs start with ‚Äúrequests per second‚Äù & what inputs are required to estimate its number

Users: Twitter has 300 million active MAUs. Not every user on Twitter is an active post-maker. 50% use daily - 150 million DAU
Usage per DAU: 10-25% make a tweet. Again. this doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; getting within an order of magnitude should be fine. Say each DAU. on average. makes 2 tweets: so 0.25%*2 = 0.5 tweets per DAU.
Scaling factor: Usage rate for a service has peaks & valleys throughout the day. Eg: The usage rate for your favorite e-commerce store or food delivery app will heavily increase in the case of discounts or sales in a particular festive season. We need to estimate how high the traffic would peak compared to the average. This would reflect the request per second peak where the design could potentially break. Most people tweet in the morning. so the tweet creation traffic is twice the average when US east coast wakes up.
Thus. total tweets in a day = 150 M DAU * (0.5 tweets/DAU) * (2x scaling factor in the morning)
Thus. requests per second = n/(number of seconds in a day) = n/86400 ~ 1500 tweets per second.
Let‚Äôs now look at how much storage is required for storing multimedia files for tweets.

150 million daily tweets. Say 10% of these tweets contain pictures of average size 300kB each & 1% of tweets contain videos of about 50MB each.
Let‚Äôs assume that the files are replicated with 3 copies each & atleast stored for 5 years.
Storage required for pictures = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.1 of tweets have images)* 300kB (image size) * 3copies = 13.5TB.
Storage required for videos per day = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.01 of tweets have videos) * (50MB video size) * 3copies ~ 225TB.
Total storage required for multimedia files per day = 238.5TB
Just the text for a tweet can be stored within 160B (i.e. 1280 bits ~ 160 characters per tweet on average)
Storage required for tweets per day = 150 M * (160B tweet size) * 3copies = 72GB
Let‚Äôs calculate overall storage cost for Twitter
Thus. we learnt that. for running Twitter. in the most basic sense. the following requirements must be met:

Assuming no data compression & our simple 3x replication. in the most basic form - 238.5TB blob storage required for storing all the multimedia of tweets that arrive in a day. 72 GB storage in database is required just for storing the basic tweet content.
Twitter was founded in 2006. However. it launched image sharing in 2011 & video sharing in 2013.
Thus. we can assume. that average storage required per day for videos uploaded by a growing user base can be our current estimate multiplied by a normalization factor of 0.6 (considering 15% of user growth on average. every year. since year of founding).
Thus. we have about (225TB video storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (9 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 443.5PB videos stored.
Similarly for image storage we have (13.5TB photo storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (11 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 32.52PB images stored
To store total multimedia for 11 years worth tweets. in the most fault tolerant & redundant manner. we need - 443.5+32.52 ~ 476.02PB (this figure is close to the actual ballpark around 500PB that Twitter has officially shared here)
Twitter uses AWS for storage of tweets & accompanying multimedia files. Say we use intelligent tiering by S3 to pay for data. that is most recent & popularly accessed. Other data. we can archive. & fetch on demand & pay for.
Estimating the media storage cost
476.02PB can be broken down into. say - 300 PB till 2019 (considering that video & images got introduced late) and 276PB after 2017.
Assuming the worst case pricing of S3 (the standard pricing) - All the multimedia of the last 3 years‚Äô tweets can be stored in S3 regular access & the other. can be stored in S3 archives (so we save cost) Thus. as per S3 pricing values. we end up paying:

For 300PB in archive: 308.073.20 USD monthly

For 276PB in regular tier: 5.935.645.70 USD monthly

Every year. our estimate of Twitter. pays 6.243.718.90 USD monthly. to store our images & videos.

Estimating the database cost for our tweets
Let‚Äôs use AWS relational database DynamoDB to store tweet data in a structured form - such as user info. tweet text. number of likes & retweets.
Twitter needs to store 72GB of tweets in a regular relational database. each day. to keep the lights on.
Again. estimating our normalization factor of 0.6 to aggregate tweet data. across 16 years since Twitter supporting text sharing right from the start. we get - (72 GB tweet data per day) *(365 days)* (16 years since tweeting was launched) * 0.6 = 252.28TB
Thus. using a standard on-demand DynamoDB (unoptimized for cost. but great for scale) - the storage cost comes to 603.355.92 USD monthly. to store our data.
For an actual analysis of all the databases Twitter uses. checkout this reference link
Here‚Äôs the actual AWS calculator cost estimation performed for this purpose.

Thus. this most basic. unoptimized design of that we made. pays 82.164.897.81 USD = 82 million USD every year to AWS. to keep providing its storage services only.

We have not even begun to discuss the computing costs. the data science costs in the cloud. Also. to keep this article a light read. we haven‚Äôt taken into consideration scalability solutions such as caching. multi-AZ databases and several aspects of storage itself.

Thus. you might now understand why Elon Musk is bent on optimizing this system a lot & even implementing the ‚ÄúDeep Cuts‚Äù plan to reduce infrastructure costs by a billion. But trying to fire 50% of the workforce and have the rest leave because the ship is sinking still doesn't make sense. To top it off. if your major problem is infrastructure cost you don't fire engineers. you task engineers to reduce infrastructure costs. Now. we may not agree or disagree with this logic. but atleast we‚Äôve learnt how to ballpark the financial element of the same.

Cheat Sheet for Back of the Envelope
We studied a way of estimating the storage cost borne by Twitter. But what about getting the speed of a video-game streaming platform? Or the requests per second of a payment gateway?

Fear not. here are a few important numbers that we can use to estimate useful metrics of any software system & what corresponding technical requirements it must be able to satisfy.

Queues/Streams - Requests: 1000‚Äì3000 requests/s. Throughput: 1MB-50MB/s (Write) / 2MB-100MB/s (Read)


Example queue service limits - Pub/Sub ‚Äî limits. Kinesis ‚Äî limits. SQS ‚Äî limits

Scrapers - Requests: 1000 per second. Example scraper service - Colly ‚Äî go scraper

For estimating speed/latency of the system
These 14 latency numbers. revealed by Dr. Dean (Google). form the foundation of systems designing & performance optimization. Using these numbers we can predict how long it would take for a system to perform its computations. Refer to this website and the image below as a simple lookup for these numbers

What do we understand from this

Memory is fast. but the disk is slow.
Avoid disk seeks if possible.
Simple compression algorithms are fast.
Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible.
Data centers are usually in different regions. and it takes time to send data between them.
In a nutshell
A lot of back of the envelope calculations are done with just coefficients and exponents. e.g.. c‚àó10e. Your goal is to get within an order of magnitude right that‚Äôs just e. c matters a lot less.

What did we learn

Back of the envelope calculations allow you to take a look at different variations.
When designing your system. these are the kind of calculations you should do over and over in your head.
Know the back of the envelope numbers for the building blocks of your system. It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers. you have to know how your subsystems perform. You can't make decent back of the envelope calculations if you don't know what's happening.
Monitor and measure every part of your system so you can make these sorts of projections from real data.
I hope you understood how systems are operated in terms of estimating engineering infrastructure requirements. provisions & costing. What‚Äôs the one system that you want me to target next for back of the envelope analysis?

üí°
Tensor is a number/collection of numbers that maintains its meaning under transformations
üí°
More complex. but correct definition - An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules.
Each index of a tensor ranges over the number of dimensions of space. However. the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta).

Tensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices). vectors (that have exactly one index). and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.
Tensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity. fluid mechanics. and general relativity.
Beginner-friendly
Clearing the meaning. usage and confusions about tensors in ML and math
Tensors. a crucial concept in the field of machine learning. deep learning. and data science. often become a stumbling block for many learners. To fully grasp the idea. we'll break it down. explore examples. and demystify various related aspects such as rank. dimension. components. indices. size. and shape.

What are Tensors?
In simple terms. tensors are a generalization of scalars. vectors. and matrices. They can be seen as multidimensional arrays of numbers. with each dimension known as a rank.

A scalar is a single number. a tensor of rank 0.
A vector is an array of numbers. a tensor of rank 1.
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. a tensor of rank 2.
A 3D array. or a "cube" of numbers. is a tensor of rank 3.
The ranks continue to increase to define higher dimensional spaces.

Breaking Down the Definition of a Tensor
The formal definition of a tensor. "An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules." often overwhelms beginners. So. let's simplify it:

"nth-rank tensor": Rank refers to the number of dimensions or indices the tensor has. For example. a rank 1 tensor is a vector (which has one dimension). a rank 2 tensor is a matrix (which has two dimensions). and so on.
"m-dimensional space": This refers to the size of each dimension. For a matrix (rank 2 tensor). this would be the number of rows and columns.
"m^n components": Components are the individual elements or data points that make up the tensor. For example. in a matrix. each number is a component.
Simplifying with Examples
Consider a 3x3 image with three color channels (Red. Green. Blue). It is represented as a 3D array or a rank 3 tensor. with dimensions of 3 (height) x 3 (width) x 3 (color channels). It would have 3^3 or 27 components (individual color values for pixels).

Delving Deeper: Case of a 4x4 Image
Let's take a more specific example: a 4x4 pixel image with three color channels. Here. the tensor would have a rank of 3 (height. width. and color channels). The dimensions would be 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels). and there would be 4^3 or 64 components.

The indices here refer to the position of each component within the tensor. For example. you might reference the red color value of the pixel in the second row and third column as [2.3.1]. where '2' refers to the row. '3' refers to the column. and '1' refers to the red channel.

The size of this tensor would be calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions together. resulting in 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels) = 48. The shape of this tensor would be (4. 4. 3). describing the number of elements along each dimension.

Difference Between Rank and Dimension
While both terms describe the structure of a tensor. they represent different aspects. The rank is the number of dimensions. while the dimensions refer to the size (or length) of each of those dimensions. In the case of our 4x4 pixel image tensor. the rank is 3. and the dimensions are 4. 4. and 3.

Sample Log of a 4x4x3 Tensor
A 4x4 pixel image with three color channels can be represented as a 3D array (or rank 3 tensor). Each pixel's color is represented by a 3-element vector (for the three color channels). and the image consists of a 4x4 grid of such pixels. giving us a shape of (4. 4. 3).

A 4x4 pixel image with 3 color channels could be represented as a 4x4x3 tensor. like this:


tensor = [
    [  # First row of pixels
        [230. 10. 10].    # Red-ish
        [230. 230. 10].  # Yellow-ish
        [10. 230. 10].   # Green-ish
        [10. 230. 230]   # Cyan-ish
    ].
    [  # Second row of pixels
        [10. 10. 230].   # Blue-ish
        [230. 10. 230].  # Magenta-ish
        [220. 220. 220]. # Light gray
        [120. 120. 120]  # Gray
    ].
    [  # Third row of pixels
        [30. 30. 30].    # Dark gray
        [230. 50. 10].   # Different shade of red
        [230. 230. 60].  # Different shade of yellow
        [10. 60. 230]    # Different shade of blue
    ].
    [  # Fourth row of pixels
        [40. 230. 40].   # Different shade of green
        [50. 10. 230].   # Another shade of blue
        [230. 40. 230].  # Another shade of magenta
        [10. 40. 10]     # Dark green
    ]
]



Clearing the Confusion Around "Dimension"
The term "dimension" can lead to some confusion. In the context of tensors. "dimension" often refers to the depth of nested lists. not the geometric or mathematical space that a vector might represent. So. a vector like [3. 4] is a rank-1 tensor (or one-dimensional array) because it involves no nesting of lists. Its shape is considered to be (2.) because it contains two elements.

In summary. tensors. while initially appearing complex. can be demystified and understood through the step-by-step breakdown of their components and properties. As multidimensional arrays. they provide the foundation for manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning. making them a fundamental concept for anyone delving into these fields.

Advanced
Exploring more properties of tensors
Understanding Covariance & Contravariance
A vector can be expressed in terms of its contravariant or covariant components

CASE 1: Expressing in terms of contravariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of components with basis vectors

üí°
We need 1 index for each of the components as there is only 1 directional indicator per component. 1 index. 1 basis vector. per component
If we decrease the length of the ‚Äúbasic vectors‚Äù (in a vector space). then the number of components required to make up a vector increases. Because the index & the number of components change contrary to each other. they are known as contravariant components of a vector Describing a vector in terms of these contravariant components (eg : 2 i + 3 j + 4 k) is how we usually describe a vectors


CASE 2: Expressing in terms of covariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of dot-product with basis vectorsIf we decrease the length of the basis vectors. then the dot-product decreases & vice versa. Since these properties are varying in the same way. we say that these are covariant components of a vector.


Specifying the notation for covariant & contravariant components


Now. say we take 2 vectors V & P

üí°
Index (for this rank 2 tensor. i.e. a vector) = unique combination of basis vectors
CASE 1: We multiply the contravariant values of V & P. On considering all possible ways. we get a matrix:

This will give us a tensor of rank 2 with 2 contra-variant index values. Here. each T value is called an element of this tensor. And since for each element. 2 indices (2 directional indicators are required) eg: Understanding by example. say we have a combination of 3 area vectors & 3 force vectors. To get the combination of all the forces on all the area vectors. for each such combination. we require 2 indices (i.e. 2 directional indicators ‚Üí 1 for the force & 1 for the area). We get 9 components. each with 2 indices (referring to 2 basis vectors)

What makes a tensor a tensor. is that. when the basis vectors change. the components of the tensor would change in the same manner as they would in one of these objects ‚Üí thus keeping the overall combination the same

What is it about the combination of components & basis vectors that makes tensors so powerful ‚Üí all observers in all reference frames agree. not on the components or the basis vectors ‚Üí but on their combinations. because they are the same

Index & Rank of tensors
üí°
Rank = the total number of indices = total number of coordinate systems (we need to have knowledge of to understand the location of the tensor) = total number of unique basis vector combinations = total number of unique linearly independent combinations = The total number of contravariant and covariant indices of a tensor.

The rank R of a tensor is independent of the number of dimensions N of the underlying space.
A tensor does not necessarily have to be created from vector components as is shown in these examples

A tensor of rank 1 is a ‚Äúvector‚Äù and has a number associated with each of the basis vectors. Only 1 index i.e. 1 combo of basis vectors is required to know the location


Here. \($V^1 = 5. V^2 = 3. V^3 = 2$\)


A tensor of rank 2 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 2 basis vectors


In a tensor of rank 3 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 3 basis vectors - composed of the components of 3 basis vectors. We can create different descriptions of this tensor by using different contravariant & covariant components of the basis vectors




More mathematical facts
While the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors. the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry. intended to represent physical space) . and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.
Objects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars. those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors. and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation. a vector v would be written $v_i$. where i=1. .... m. and matrix is a tensor of type (1.1). which would be written $a_i^j$ in tensor notation.
Tensors may be operated on by other tensors (such as metric tensors. the permutation tensor. or the Kronecker delta) or by tensor operators (such as the covariant derivative). The manipulation of tensor indices to produce identities or to simplify expressions is known as index gymnastics. which includes index lowering and index raising as special cases. These can be achieved through multiplication by a so-called metric tensor $g_{ij}. g^{ij}. g_i^j$. etc.. e.g..
Tensor notation can provide a very concise way of writing vector and more general identities. For example. in tensor notation. the dot product u¬∑v is simply written u¬∑v = $u_iv^i$ If two tensors A and B have the same rank and the same covariant and contravariant indices. then they can be added in the obvious way.
The generalization of the dot product applied to tensors is called tensor contraction. and consists of setting two unlike indices equal to each other and then summing using the Einstein summation convention. Various types of derivatives can be taken of tensors. the most common being the comma derivative and covariant derivative.
If the components of any tensor of any tensor rank vanish in one particular coordinate system. they vanish in all coordinate systems. A transformation of the variables of a tensor changes the tensor into another whose components are linear homogeneous functions of the components of the original tensor.
Tensors in the context of machine learning
The property of tensors to maintains its meaning under transformations is used also by machine learning. where real world data is transformed into corresponding tensors & then heavy calculations are done on these tensors to get valuable insights.

I used to just get so confused for understanding how do I actually incorporate a culture of powerful customer obsession that big companies like Amazon. Airbnb. Stripe speak so strongly about.

What does it mean? How does that change your workflow? What small optimizations can you do that can ensure you become such a company?

Yeah. you don't need a dedicated team for that - I want to list simple things you can do as a solopreneur in a garage as well.

Here's 4 learnings that I've had. from my current and previous startup. on how to build a reflex muscle for customer obsession. from 120+ overall interviews I've done.

0] an intro to the topic
Customer-centricity means you just know so much about the customer. that when you take decisions about product. you can tell exactly how your customers will react to it.

It's important because it builds very great relationship with them and they will stand by your team and product even when things don't work out that well.

1] 5hrs of talktime per week
If you're having less than 5hrs of talktime with customers. that means you either know everything about them or you need to find a different set of people to talk to. who're willing to spend time to discuss the problem.

Easy ways to get this:

Start by just asking your friends for people in their companies or families for a call and ask them to connect further. If you don't know anyone. just cold reachout your competitors' customers on Linkedin
Just ask for 25min calls. They seem shorter than 30 for some reason so I've seen people say yes and then give you the extra 5.
Ask them to not refer to "anyone". but "1 name" that they can think of - this is fast. and has 100% success rate.
Setup a communication channel on a platform they're most comfortable on. (Whatsapp. Telegram. Discord etc.) where you can just keep talking to them as friends
2] Less than a day of turnaround time
When you're a young company. you can provide near instanteneous customer support and that goes a long way in turning early adopters into evangelists. This is simple - just have them as priority notifications and swear you will reply something the moment you see a popup. Direct lines with founders who ping back quick feel very nice.

3] Organizing their feedback
This is the most important part. I'm sharing my company's template for this. It's just colorful stickies you can move around. but captures certain key snippets across multiple customers really well.

Just pick key sentences they say. tag and color them well - really helps a lot. Here's an example


At our company Recontact. we're helping people be amazing at building long-term relationships in professional and personal settings

Using this strategy. we figured out (check video) that "Maintenance" (i.e. keeping in touch with people) - was the most talked about point in our problem statement - because it had more stickies. And that realization saved us from spending 2 weeks worth of time in making "Search" in our app more efficient - because that's not what our customers cared about.

So yeah. that coloring and legend-making you did as a kid - well that's one of the key components in making a customer-centric business.

4] Building a muscle for the info
Revise. revise. revise. This. I learned from Apple CEO Tim Cook - who starts his day with reading random customer emails. Well. you can always read these stickies. Look into a simple analytics dashboard you can create for your app. - template link

You won't see it instantly. but. over time. a decision-making muscle gets built (very much like driving. music. fashion-sense) - that is very grounded in qualitative and quantitative analysis of customer feedback.

Listen to even the smallest details - you might not remember instantly. but then you'll be surprised how often you'll randomly remember a customer fact. when making a decision related to it.

In closing
You can be crazy passionate about this too - write customer snippets on your wall. listen to customer interviews at the gym. be thoughtful with delighting gifts. send personalized notes when their kids graduate etc. etc. etc.

Bottom line - Be close to the customer. even though the product will not work out. your company will. Business runs on trust and mutual respect.

"Social Capital" is simply the "network of relationships and acquantainces" that a person has developed over life".

We all hear fancy ass quotes about "making strong professional relations". "staying in touch with friends" and "your network is your net-worth". Here's a quick rundown of the best-selling way to build such social capital. since the past 80 years and beyond! Basically. become more likeable.

These are my key pointers from the book "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie. Each topic is its own tweetstorm - so kick back and read these wisdom snippets to help you build a strong people network.

With that let's dive in by understanding 6 ways to be a person who's good at making friends.

6 ways to make people like you
üí°
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
A dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love

You can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can. in 2 years. by trying to get other people interested in you

When you see a group photograph that you're in. whose picture do you look for first ?

It is the individual who is not interested in his/her fellow men/women who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring

You have to be interested in people if you wanna be a successful writer of stories

Can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them

eg : To call someone for an interview. write a letter first enclosing a list of questions that you except them to answer about themselves and their method of work

To find out someone's birthday ‚áí Begin by asking whether he/she believes the date of anyone's birth has anything to do with character or disposition

A show of interest. like every other human emotion. must be sincere

üí°
2. Smile
A smile says - "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you". That is why dogs make such a hit

A real smile. a heartwarming smile. a smile that comes from within. the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace

People who smile. tend to manage. teach and sell more effectively

Smile comes through in your voice

Hard work alone is the magic ¬†key that will unlock the door to our desires. People have succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. As the fun becomes work. people change ‚áí lose joy in it. leading business to grow dull and fail

Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Different mental attitude

Action seems to follow feeling but really. action and feeling go together and by regulating the action. which is under the more direct control of the will. we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not

Thus. the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there

Most folks are about as happy as they make up our minds to be

Picture in your mind. the able. earnest. useful person you desire to be and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual

A man/woman without a smiling face must not open a shop. It costs nothing but creates much

üí°
3. A person's name is to that person. the sweetest and most important sound in any language
The average person is more interested in his or her own name in all the other names on earth put together
Remember that name and call it easily. and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage
The executive who can't remember names can't remember a significant part of his/ her business and is operating on quicksand
Take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds
Most important ways of gaining good will is by remembering names and making people feel important
To recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion
To repeat the name several times during conversation and try to associate it with the person's features. expression and general appearance
Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices
Magic contained in a name should be realized as the single item. wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else.
The name sets the individual apart; it makes him/ her unique among all others
The info we are imparting or the request we are making takes on special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.
From the waitress to the senior executive herself. the name will work magic as we deal with others.
üí°
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention
Dale Carnegie on listening and responding ‚áí Hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise
Good conversationalists are merely good listeners who encourage a person to talk
"Yes. and" - pay attention and show indications of it from time to time with approval or disapproval.
Important personages crave a good listener but ordinary folk do too.
"Many a person call a doctor when all they want is an audience"
If you wanna know how to PREVENT making people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you. here is the recipe :
Always listen to anyone for long
Don't talk incessantly about yourself
If you have an idea while the other person is talking. wait for him/ her to finish
People who talk of themselves think only of themselves
Those people who think of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. no matter how instructed they may be
People you might be talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems
Therefore. if you aspire to be a good conversationalist. be an attentive listener
üí°
5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests
Theodore Roosevelt used to sit up late the night before. reading up on the subject in which he knew the guest is particularly interested in
Road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he/ she treasures most
The reward is an enlargement of life each time you speak to someone
üí°
6. Make the other person feel important ‚Äî and do it sincerely
If we are contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get somethin out of the other person in return ‚Äî we shall meet with the failure that we so richly deserve
Attain the feeling that you have done something for him/ her without his/ her being able to do anything in return for you
The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated ~ William James
Do unto others and you would have others do unto you
Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you". "Would you be so kind as to ‚Äî?". "Won't you please ?". "Would you mind". "Thank you ‚Äî" little courtesies like these. oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday and. incidentally. they are the hallmark of good breeding
The power of honest appreciation is stupendous as everyone considers themselves imp
Every person I meet is my superior in some way ¬†~Emerson
Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
In conclusion
Be interested. smile. remember their name. listen more. talk about their interests and make them feel important. You nail that and you find yourself as a likeable. good friend who is connected to a lot of different kinds of people very well.

This is going to be a super fast guide for developers to leverage platform development tools with VR and build cool apps. Starting with just a laptop and a Meta Quest in your hand.

Here's what the final thing looks like:


Code
Here's the GitHub Repo containing all the code - https://github.com/CMU-SV-Ronith/sem_3pi

Introduction to VR and AI-Generated NPCs
Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we interact with digital environments. offering immersive experiences that blur the lines between the virtual and real world. One of the most exciting advancements in VR is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). especially in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with users in more human-like ways. This blog post delves into the creation of an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. highlighting the technological synergy of VR and AI.

Choosing the Right Engine
When embarking on VR app development. selecting the right engine is crucial. Two prominent engines are Unity and Unreal. After extensive research and testing. Unity emerged as the preferable choice for several reasons:

Ease of Learning and Accessibility: Unity uses C#. known for its simpler syntax and automatic memory management. This choice makes Unity accessible. especially for beginners and indie developers. unlike Unreal Engine's complex C++.
Asset Store and Community Support: Unity boasts an expansive Asset Store. providing numerous resources that speed up development. Coupled with an active community. developers have access to extensive support and shared knowledge.
Versatility in 2D and 3D Development: Unity's proficiency in both 2D and 3D development offers flexibility. allowing developers to work on various project types without switching engines.
Platform Support and Integration: Unity's broad platform support. including PCs. consoles. mobile devices. and VR systems. is vital for developers targeting diverse audiences.
Strong Documentation and Educational Resources: Unity‚Äôs comprehensive documentation and learning resources are invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.
Making API Calls in C# with Code-Walkthrough
We code in C# in Unity. Here's a simple video on integrating Unity App with C# code that you write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgUIx75fJ_E

This was used for the Speech Analysis and Text Analysis functions.

To integrate AI into our VR app. we need to make API calls. This is achieved through UnityEngine.Networking. setting up coroutines for HTTP(s) communications. The process involves getting and posting information. waiting for responses. and updating the UI to reflect changes. We utilize AWS for backend services and the Dolby Media Speech Analytics API for speech analysis.

The AnalyzeText coroutine sends a user's transcript to our backend for processing. while GetAnalysisResults retrieves the analysis. The AnalyseSpeech coroutine sends audio files for speech analysis. and UploadFileToS3 handles the uploading of files to AWS S3.

                uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonUtility.ToJson(requestJson))).
                downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer()
            };

            request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type". "application/json");
            request.SetRequestHeader("x-api-key". "YOUR_API_KEY"); // Replace with your actual API key

            yield return request.SendWebRequest();

            if (request.isNetworkError || request.isHttpError)

            }

            var res = transcriptionTask.Result;
            StartCoroutine(AnalyzeText(res.Text));
        }
Creating NPCs with Inworld.ai and Trigger Words
NPCs are given life using tools like Inworld.ai. which allows for the creation of characters with specific goals and triggers. For instance. an NPC can be programmed to give a task when a user says a particular phrase. This adds an interactive layer to the VR experience. making it more engaging and realistic.

The code snippet for NPC interaction demonstrates how to set up these interactions. It includes setting up goals. defining trigger phrases. and programming responses and actions based on user interaction.

Reference video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVDoMnkw4rY

Complete Code and Overall Walkthrough
The complete code combines all these elements into a cohesive VR app. It demonstrates the integration of various APIs. handling of voice and text inputs. and interaction with NPCs. The code is structured to ensure seamless interaction within the VR environment. enabling users to experience a realistic and interactive AI interview.

This guide offers a window into the intricate process of developing an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. By combining Unity's versatile development environment with powerful APIs and AI-driven NPCs. developers can create engaging and immersive VR experiences. The future of VR and AI in app development is undoubtedly bright. offering endless possibilities for innovation and user engagement.

This article is a refresher to anyone looking to build in sales - the current approach. terminology. key insights. challenges and opportunities available in this domain.


What is a sales funnel?
A sales funnel is the marketing term for the journey potential customers go through on the way to purchase. There are several steps to a sales funnel. usually known as the top. middle. and bottom of the funnel. although these steps may vary depending on a company's sales model.

A basic sales funnel can be described as consisting of 4 levels. Marketers can take inspiration from this basic structure to design a sales funnel that suits the needs of their organisation.

Awareness: At the very top of the sales funnel is the awareness stage that is populated by the largest number of people. These people. not quite ready to be prospects yet. have just had their first interactions with your company and its offerings. They don‚Äôt know much about your brand at this stage. but are aware that it exists.
Interest: The first interactions will hook some of these newly-aware people and draw them slightly deeper into the funnel. With their interest piqued. these people will spend some time getting to know more about your company and your offerings. They might browse your website or catalogue. read your blogs. or peruse reviews from past customers.
Consideration: Armed with knowledge gathered during the interest stage. your prospects will double down on their efforts to know your company and offerings better. They may reach out to your customer service team with specific questions. or fill out a form to access more information. Remember. by this stage they may have already compared your offerings to those of your competitors. So. it is important to clearly answer their questions and help them understand how your offerings can solve their problems or needs.
Negotiation and decision: The prospect has now almost decided to purchase your product or service. Depending on the nature of your offerings. they might begin a negotiation over the price. terms of purchase. or both. But it‚Äôs fair to assume that they have a purchase intention at this stage.
At the end of this stage ‚Äîthe prospect and seller have negotiated the terms of the sale to their mutual satisfaction. and the prospect pays the seller to officially become a buyer.
Extra - Renewal or repurchase: The sale stage is not the end of the sales funnel. Soon a time will come when the sales contract is up for renewal. The customer must now decide if they want to continue with the same seller. If so. there might be a fresh round of negotiations over price and purchase terms. followed by a renewal or repurchase.

Here's an image of the currently most widely used Sales tools and the stage of the funnel they're utilized in:


Why is a sales funnel imp?
That‚Äôs the value of knowing a sales funnel: Successful sellers understand the journey a prospect is likely to take before they buy. and can make sure they‚Äôre ready to move on to each stage. They‚Äôre focused on the buyer. meeting their needs in the moment and building trust that helps move the deal forward.

So what if you ditched the sales funnel? You‚Äôd run the risk of focusing too much on the close to hit quota. pushing products or services when prospects aren‚Äôt ready. Win rates would drop because prospects wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the solutions they‚Äôre offered. and trust would be lost. No long-term relationships. no cross-sells. or upsells.

What challenges does sales have in 2023?
Challenge 1: Standing Out From the Competition
To differentiate from others. salespeople should exceed prospects' expectations by being well-versed in their CRM and sales software. and staying updated with industry trends and news.
Today. SaaS companies offer personalised email marketing. educational content. and in-depth exploratory calls with experienced representatives. Therefore. if you want to stand out from the crowd. you must be one step ahead of the already high standards of helpful. inbound selling.
Gather sales enablement materials like industry specific demos. case studies. reviews. testimonials. and analytics tools or reports.
Keep up with industry news. trends. and reports to help prospects guide strategy and show the potential ROI to their supervisors or other decision makers.
Set up alerts and automation to help you follow up with prospects at the right time and provide valuable resources.
Existing tools - Apollo.io. Outreach.io
Opportunity: This presents an opportunity to innovate in personalized and inbound selling.
Challenge 2: Meeting Quotas
A sales representative's best strategy for achieving quotas and converting leads is to make phone calls - whether they are selling remotely or not.
2. Two thirds of salespeople also use discounts and promotions. and more than half report that they increase sales. The most popular promotion among sellers is bundling a suite of products. followed by free trials.

Challenge 3: Getting in Direct Contact with Decision-Makers
With remote work becoming prevalent. establishing a strong social media presence. particularly on LinkedIn. is crucial for connecting with decision-makers.
In 2023. 67% of sales representatives worked under a hybrid or fully remote basis. and globally. almost 70% of professionals worked remotely. Many leaders and decision makers have physically moved to new locations farther away from their headquarters as industry events have largely shifted to virtual and hybrid formats.
It's crucial that salespeople establish their own presence on social media if they haven't already done so. LinkedIn was rated as the most effective platform for prospect research by nearly three quarters of sales professionals.
Challenge 4: Lack of High-Quality Leads
The first place to look when dealing with lead quality issues is sales and marketing alignment. Having a shared understanding of the ideal customer profile or buyer persona for sales and marketing teams is essential.
Assess the lifetime value of customers and which ones turn into promoters in order to develop and update these assets.
Using tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. HubSpot Sales Hub. LeadIQ. and others. sales teams find and engage with prospects at the right time after identifying target customers.
Challenge 5: Keeping Prospects Engaged Throughout the Sales Process
It is important to understand your buyer in terms of the bigger picture context so you can keep their interest throughout the sales process. which can be lengthy depending on the software package or service you are selling.
It is common for sales representatives to communicate with prospects two to seven times during B2B and B2C sales processes. which adds up when considering that most work with dozens of prospects at once.
The use of automated sales management tools and CRMs with lead intelligence and logging of communications with prospects (such as phone calls. emails. and actions) can help sales teams manage hundreds of data points to successfully acquire new customers.
Challenge 6: Difficulty Getting Meetings With Prospects
Timing is everything. Reach out at the wrong time. you‚Äôre a nuisance. Reach out at the right time. and you‚Äôre the answer to a prayer. It‚Äôs well known in the industry that the best salespeople spend most of their time on calls with prospects listening.
In order to secure meetings with qualified prospects. the best strategy is to listen. And to make it easy to meet with you. When listening for signals that a prospect is ready to meet. use these questions as a guide:
Social selling requires a combination of social media savvy and sales tools that can automatically flag key readiness indicators and send automatic alerts.
Key insights from 30+ interviews with sales and growth teams
Over the past 3 weeks. with conversations over 30 sales people. here are the key insights that stood out from my learnings in the current approach:

Efficiency in Data Management: Many use tools like Excel and Salesforce for data organization. but there's a challenge in maintaining data hygiene and integrating personal notes effectively.
Personalized Customer Engagement: Sales reps emphasize personalized interactions. like remembering personal details about clients and customizing outreach. This includes tactics like social media engagement. client lunches. and gift-giving.
Utilization of Digital Tools: Sales teams heavily rely on digital tools like CRM systems. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. and calendar reminders for tracking client interactions and industry news.
Challenges with Remote and Hybrid Sales: Adapting to remote and hybrid sales environments is a notable challenge. affecting how sales reps connect with decision-makers and clients.
Importance of Relationship Building: There's a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships. seen as crucial in high-value sales.
Adapting to Market and Client Dynamics: Sales reps must adapt to changing client personnel and market conditions.
Efficient Use of Time and Resources: Balancing time spent on tasks like data entry and client engagement is crucial. especially in cold outreach and event networking.
Conclusion
In summary. the sales funnel remains a vital concept in the sales process. guiding potential customers from awareness to purchase.

In 2023. sales teams face challenges like standing out from the competition. meeting quotas. and effectively engaging with decision-makers. particularly in remote and hybrid work environments.

Utilizing digital tools like CRMs and LinkedIn. focusing on personalized customer engagement. and maintaining efficient data management are essential strategies. Building strong relationships and adapting to market dynamics are key to navigating these challenges.

Sales teams must balance innovative selling techniques with the efficient use of time and resources to succeed in the evolving sales landscape.

This blog is from notes from an amazing talk at the OpenAI DevDay conference by Colin Jarvis and John Allard. Here's the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y)
In the realm of natural language processing. optimizing large language models (LLMs) is a formidable challenge. Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity. The performance of LLMs. often abstract and difficult to measure. requires a nuanced approach to optimization. In this blog. we‚Äôll explore a mental model of options for LLM optimization and develop an appreciation for which option to use and when.

You will leave with a foundational understanding of the two axes of optimization‚Äîcontext and LLM behavior‚Äîas well as a practical guide to the nuanced world of model refinement.

The Twin Axes of Optimization

1. Context Optimization
At its core. context optimization is about fine-tuning what the model needs to know. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:

Prompt Engineering: As the lower-left quadrant in our optimization matrix. prompt engineering is your fast lane to setting a baseline. Start by refining the prompts you feed into the LLM and observe the performance changes.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Positioned in the upper-left. RAG introduces more context. Begin with simple retrieval mechanisms. and consider fine-tuning for a more nuanced approach.
2. LLM Behavior Optimization
LLM behavior optimization delves into how the model should act. The two main strategies are:

Fine-tuning: The lower-right quadrant represents fine-tuning. which customizes the LLM‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks.
Comprehensive Approach: Sometimes. a combination of all methods is required to reach the desired performance level. An example would be integrating HyDE retrieval with a fact-checking step.
The key is to start somewhere. evaluate. and then iterate with another method.

Strategies Explored
Prompt Engineering: The Starting Block
Starting with clear. concise instructions and breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks is paramount. Giving models "time to think" and testing changes systematically can yield surprising improvements. Extending this by providing reference text and using external tools can further enhance the results.


When It Shines:

Quick testing and learning
Establishing a baseline for further optimization
Its Limitations:

Introducing new information
Replicating complex styles or methodologies

Retrieval Augmented Generation: Expanding Knowledge
By giving LLMs access to domain-specific content. RAG helps update the model's knowledge and control the content it generates to reduce inaccuracies.


When It Shines:

Introducing new. specific information
Controlling content to reduce errors
Its Limitations:

Broad domain understanding
Learning new languages. formats. or styles
Enhancing RAG:

Employ retrieval with cosine similarity and HyDE
Experiment with FT embeddings and chunking
Implement reranking and classification steps
Evaluating RAG:

On the LLM side. consider the faithfulness and relevance of the answers.
On the content side. assess the precision and recall of the context retrieved. More data does not necessarily equate to higher accuracy.

Fine-tuning: The Custom Tailor
When prompt engineering doesn't cut it. fine-tuning may be the right path. Continuing the training process with domain-specific data can optimize model performance and efficiency. For example. Canva leveraged fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to produce structured output. showcasing the power of high-quality training data.


When It Shines:

Emphasizing existing knowledge
Customizing response structure or tone
Its Limitations:

Injecting new knowledge into the model
Quick iterations on new use-cases
Steps to Fine-tune:

Data preparation
Hyperparameter selection and loss function understanding during training
Evaluation with relevant test sets and expert opinion
Fine-tuning Best Practices:

Start with prompt engineering
Establish a clear baseline
Prioritize quality over quantity in training data

The Combined Approach: Fine-tuning + RAG
Sometimes. a blend of fine-tuning and RAG yields the best results. This method allows the model to understand complex instructions with minimal tokens. creating more space for retrieved context and leading to a more robust performance.




Practical Application
The real-world application of these strategies can be as creative as generating hypothetical answers to enhance similarity searches. For example. initial baselines might yield a 69% performance rate. while a RAG with a well-crafted answer could increase that to 84%. comparable to fine-tuning. Collaborations. such as the one between Scale AI and OpenAI. demonstrate how a combined approach can optimize models to new heights of efficiency and effectiveness.


Careful what you fine-tune on
In conclusion. maximizing LLM performance isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It requires a toolkit of strategies‚Äîfrom prompt engineering to fine-tuning and beyond‚Äîeach with its own set of benefits and best-use scenarios.

there needs to be a part of education that allows students to dream and tinker and take risks. Something that makes them laugh and cry and hope and bond and stay up late in teams and chase self-assigned deadlines and ship something they would have never thought they could.

that was the ideal of buildschool.

we wanted to give students "an ecosystem of believer-builders who built things to solve problems because they wanted to". and having friends around always helps.

but the issue was. we were targeting a student base who had just come back from remote learning. who was not entirely immersed into this tinkering culture and was more driven by definite career paths.

in April 2022. Technical Society (TechSoc) started with minimal funding. full motivation and targeted growth hacks. to grow a strong community. I think the best takebacks from this journey are perseverence. dealing with ambiguity. and faith in the dreamers of tomorrow.

and our approach at TechSoc has always been - invest in the team. invest in the participants and invest in the future. here's 3 stages of how we built a community from scratch and run it well. to this day.

üí°
This journey was only possible due to the amazing contribution by Anouksha Hemanth. Prabhat Bedida. Subham Sagar. Yashaswi. Piyush Agrawal. Nikshay Jain. Vishwajeet. GK Harish and several others who made this vision real.¬†
building a team
first. we had to make team buildschool believe that the mission they were solving was important because they would be enablers of a movement much bigger than themselves. so Anouksha and me used YCombinator's startup school curriculum and actually had each manager at buildschool study startup from a perspective of product strategy. history. revenue and future steps. this helped them understand how products are built. gain confidence in talking more about these ideas and also be better thinkers in general. over 2.5 months we did multiple startup teardowns. had these people practice cold emailing founders and speaking comfortably with them. here are some of their early day case studies.

once our little army was ready. it was time to go to war. boy. was it going to be brutal.

inspiring a community
the early days were very random and we had barely any clue of processes and contacts and pretty much anything. we were just very clear on what we had to solve - get 10 student prototypes. not powerpoints. out by the next 13 weeks.

to begin with. the issue was. how do you even get people to care to solve problems? it was always cooler to do fancy PoRs that add sure-shot resume points as opposed to taking a bet on whether you and your buddies could build something or not

and even if people do care. how do you get them to actually learn this process of product building - right from design. to shipping to release to iteration and beyond? well. the answer actually lies in inspiring people.

as Simon Sinek says. if you connect with the "why" of people. you can truly move them to do unbelievable things. and we did all sorts of crazy things to get the message across. here's a video from the early days. just a whiteboard. an ai generated thumbnail and some students talking about a crazy vision of 10 teams. 10 weeks. 10 prototypes.


we did speak to people and touch upon a nerve.

to further this. we revived the history of the "fun in building" through our alumnus Kedar Kulkarni - who started off with very realistic stories of moving up the quality ladder by building computer vision fun-tools with his friends and then moving up to govt partnerships and funded projects. looking back. i think that may have struck a really strong chord - even in me.


something to remind students of where the foundation of innovation lies
sustaining the experience
10 teams selected. basic application on their plan for 10 weeks. we were just looking for grit.

to refine our teams. buildschool organized really amazing talks right from product research and UI designing. all the way up to engineering and growth post launch. we got CXOs and industry veterans to give talks for free - how did we do that? well. we just connected with the "why" of these disruptors through a cold email as simple as:


the thing that sold best was the thought of inspiring students to build more
boom! 7 high quality lectures in various domains - all conducted at zero cost. well. except for the food. it does not have to be complex - ¬†

growth hack - give people free food and they show up the 1st time. give them a memorable experience and they will keep showing up again and again.


give them pizza and they'll do amazing things
and it was hard. students want to do all sorts of things at all times. so we used accountability partners called "build buds" for each team to navigate through getting the right resources. connected to the right folks. and even actually finishing right before deadlines.

guess what - at a mini demo day amongst the teams - 9 of them had a functioning product! here's a random picture from the mini demo day at the 8 week mark.

investing in the future
by the time the 10th week ended. teams had transformed beyond what we had thought. people who didn't know coding had built apps. people who were shy on stage were presenting. people who were unsure about their passions had picked up something new and built something meaningful out of it. well. and the buildschool team - they had gone through the extreme rollercoaster of 0 attendee events (that really happened. it was really stressful) to having a great turnout of 9 products built in those 10 weeks and then we came for a repeat in the upcoming semesters with even more student interest. what makes me smile the most. is that people actually now think of this as a thing they can do full time.


end of buildsprint #1. november 2022
fun fact. one team even got incubated in the startup accelerator at IIT Madras. i look forward to more such stories.

‚≠êÔ∏è here's my takeaway - atleast once in life. i feel. every person must go through the pain and the fulfilment of building something from 0 to 1. because once you're on the other side of the storm - you gain the self-confidence to do anything you want.

that's what our vision at techsoc always has been. cheers and happy building!

Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart is a fantastic tool to deploy machine learning models. In this blog. we'll walk you through the process of using Jumpstart to deploy a model named "Llama2" and expose it as an API endpoint using AWS Lambda functions.

Step 1: Set Up SageMaker Domain and User
Begin by navigating to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Console. Here. create a domain and user profile. This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.

Step 2a: Deploy the Llama2 Model
After setting up your domain and user. head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the "Sagemaker Jumpstart" section. and from there. choose to deploy the "llama 7b model." This process usually takes about seven minutes. and at the end of it. you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this. as it will be essential for the next steps.

Step 2b: Integrating any Huggingface Model with Amazon Sagemaker
Instead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options. you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how

1. Setup development environment
We are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.

import sagemaker
import boto3
sess = sagemaker.Session()
# sagemaker session bucket -> used for uploading data. models and logs
# sagemaker will automatically create this bucket if it not exists
sagemaker_session_bucket=None
if sagemaker_session_bucket is None and sess is not None:
    # set to default bucket if a bucket name is not given
    sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()

    
    
def setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=None):
    """
    Params:
    - default_bucket: Default bucket name to use for the session

    Returns:
    - session: SageMaker session object
    - role_arn: ARN of the IAM execution role
    """
    global sagemaker_execution_role
    session = sagemaker.Session(default_bucket=default_bucket)

    try:
        sagemaker_execution_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
    except ValueError:
        iam = boto3.client('iam')
        sagemaker_execution_role = iam.get_role(RoleName="sagemaker_execution_role")['Role']['Arn']

    return session. sagemaker_execution_role

def mask_account_id(account_id):
    return '*' * len(account_id)

def main():
    sagemaker_session_bucket = None

    session. sagemaker_execution_role = setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=sagemaker_session_bucket)

    # Mask it
    account_id = sagemaker_execution_role.split(':')[4]
    masked_account_id = mask_account_id(account_id)
    masked_role = sagemaker_execution_role.replace(account_id. masked_account_id)

    print(f"SageMaker role ARN: {masked_role}")
    print(f"SageMaker session region: {session.boto_region_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC
Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker. we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend. session. region. and version. You can find the available versions here

from sagemaker.huggingface import get_huggingface_llm_image_uri


## Fetch docker image URI for the Hugging Face DLC:
# 1. backend name
# 2. Hugging face LDC version


# retrieve the llm image uri
llm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri(
  "huggingface".
  version="0.9.3"
)

# print ecr image uri
print(f"llm image uri: {llm_image}")

Hardware Requirements
Llama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B. 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.

Note: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.

MODEL	INSTANCE TYPE	QUANTIZATION	# OF GPUS PER REPLICA
Llama 7B	(ml.)g5.2xlarge	-	1
Llama 13B	(ml.)g5.12xlarge	-	4
Llama 70B	(ml.)g5.48xlarge	bitsandbytes	8
Llama 70B	(ml.)p4d.24xlarge	-	8
Note: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning. e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.

These are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B. 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks. we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances. since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.

It might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.

# confirm requirements met for kernel
import json

def get_instance_type_from_metadata():
    with open('/opt/ml/metadata/resource-metadata.json') as f:
        metadata = json.load(f)
        resource_name = metadata.get('ResourceName'. '')
    return resource_name

def main():
    resource_name = get_instance_type_from_metadata()

    # List valid instance types
    valid_instance_types = ['ml.g5.12xlarge'. 'ml.g5-48xlarge']

    if any(instance_type in resource_name for instance_type in valid_instance_types):
        print("Instance configured correctly")
    else:
        print("Need to upgrade to at least 'ml.g5.12xlarge' instance")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
4. Deploy Llama2 to Amazon Sagemaker
To deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id. instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type. which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.

Note: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.

import json
import getpass
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel


def get_sagemaker_config():
    # sagemaker config
    instance_type = "ml.p4d.24xlarge"
    number_of_gpu = 8
    health_check_timeout = 300

    # Define Model and Endpoint configuration parameter
    config = {
      'HF_MODEL_ID': "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf". # model_id from hf.co/models
      'SM_NUM_GPUS': json.dumps(number_of_gpu). # Number of GPU used per replica
      'MAX_INPUT_LENGTH': json.dumps(2048).  # Max length of input text
      'MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(4096).  # Max length of the generation (including input text)
      'MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(8192).  # Limits the number of tokens that can be processed in parallel during the generation
      'HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN': getpass.getpass("Enter your Hugging Face hub token")
      # .'HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE': "bitsandbytes". # comment in to quantize
    }
    return instance_type. health_check_timeout. config

def create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. image_uri):
    # check if token is set
    assert config['HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN'] != "". "Please set your Hugging Face Hub token"

    # create HuggingFaceModel with the image uri
    llm_model = HuggingFaceModel(
      role=role.
      image_uri=llm_image.
      env=config
    )
    return llm_model


def main():
    instance_type. health_check_timeout. config = get_sagemaker_config()
    
    # Set role and image_uri
    role = sagemaker_execution_role
    llm_image_to_ref = llm_image
    
    # Declare llm model with create_hugging_face_model module
    llm_model = create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. llm_image_to_ref)
    
    # Deploy model to the endpoint if llm_model is available
    if llm_model:
            llm = llm_model.deploy(
                initial_instance_count = 1.
                instance_type=instance_type.
                container_startup_health_check_timeout=health_check_timeout
            )
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
5. Run inference and chat with the model
5. Run inference and chat with the model
After our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:

temperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.
max_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20. max value is 512.
repetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. defaults to null.
seed: The seed to use for random generation. default is null.
stop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.
top_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null. which disables top-k-filtering.
top_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling. default to null.
do_sample: Whether or not to use sampling ; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.
best_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs. default to null.
details: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.
return_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.
truncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.
typical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.
watermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.
You can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation

The meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:

[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>

{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]

We create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt. which converts a List of "messages" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.

def build_llama2_prompt(messages):
    startPrompt = "<s>[INST] "
    endPrompt = " [/INST]"
    conversation = []
    for index. message in enumerate(messages):
        if message["role"] == "system" and index == 0:
            conversation.append(f"<<SYS>>\n{message['content']}\n<</SYS>>\n\n")
        elif message["role"] == "user":
            conversation.append(message["content"].strip())
        else:
            conversation.append(f" [/INST] {message['content'].strip()} </s><s>[INST] ")

    return startPrompt + "".join(conversation) + endPrompt
  
messages = [
  { "role": "system"."content": "You are a friendly and knowledgeable vacation planning assistant named Clara. Your goal is to have natural conversations with users to help them plan their perfect vacation. "}
]
# define question and add to messages
instruction = "What are some cool ideas to do in the summer?"
messages.append({"role": "user". "content": instruction})
prompt = build_llama2_prompt(messages)

chat = llm.predict({"inputs":prompt})

print(chat[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Now we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.

# hyperparameters for llm
payload = {
  "inputs":  prompt.
  "parameters": {
    "do_sample": True.
    "top_p": 0.6.
    "temperature": 0.9.
    "top_k": 50.
    "max_new_tokens": 512.
    "repetition_penalty": 1.03.
    "stop": ["</s>"]
  }
}


# send request to endpoint
response = llm.predict(payload)

print(response[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Step 3: Integrate with AWS Lambda
With your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand. navigate to AWS Lambda. Here. create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:

import json
import boto3

ENDPOINT_NAME="jumpstart-dft-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b"
runtime= boto3.client('runtime.sagemaker')

def lambda_handler(event. context):
    data = event["body"]
    print(data)
    
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME.
        ContentType='application/json'.
        Body=data.
        CustomAttributes="accept_eula=true"
    )
    
    response_content = response['Body'].read().decode()
    result = json.loads(response_content)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200.
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }
Step 4: Grant Necessary Permissions
For your Lambda function to work correctly. it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions. create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17".
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0".
      "Effect": "Allow".
      "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint".
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Step 5: Expose Lambda Function as an API
Once your function is ready and permissions are in place. expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.

Step 6: Testing Your Deployment
To test the setup. use a curl command. like the one below:

curl --location 'https://khhg37edhrmibhj4ahsxqnqlha0qoqqc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "inputs":"I believe the meaning of life is".
    "parameters":{
        "max_new_tokens":256.
        "top_p":0.9.
        "temperature":0.6
    }
}'
This command sends a POST request to your Lambda function. which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.

In Conclusion
Setting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process. It offers scalability and ease of integration. making it suitable for a range of applications. For more detailed steps and best practices. you can refer to this official AWS blog.

Futurecasting. - or the art of envisioning the unforeseen. is a crucial skill in our dynamic world where the tide of events can shift unpredictably. Our perception plays a pivotal role in determining how we steer our ship into the future.

Mental Maps and Perceptions
As individuals. we need to acknowledge that our understanding of the future is inevitably tinted by personal perceptions and biases. not objective truths. Each person's mental map. the internal framework we use to navigate decisions. varies. and these maps significantly influence the decisions made regarding the future.

The Risk of Success
Ironically. success might be one of our biggest stumbling blocks. Past triumphs can make us overly reliant on the mental maps that brought us to our current position. A strategy that yielded success in the past isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work indefinitely. and overconfidence in these tried-and-tested mental maps might blind us to other possibilities and opportunities.

The Pitfall of Incorrect Maps
As the legend goes. the first set of Spanish voyagers actually thought that there was a water body connecting south-west and north-west coast of USA. And they made a wrong map. with full confidence. not knowing their mistake. Fun fact. until 16 years. voyagers used the wrong map and after multiple complaints. they were finally able to break the mental model of the government to actually update the map. And that process took 160 years total. The story of the erroneous map of the USA. used for 160 years due to stubborn belief in its accuracy. serves as a telling example. An incorrect understanding leads to misguided actions. and once a particular map (or belief) is accepted. altering it becomes a formidable challenge.

Asking Uncomfortable Questions
Futurecasting is not about comfort; it's about preparedness and openness to disquieting truths. It requires us to challenge our convictions and ask questions that make us squirm. This process involves thinking divergently about what lies ahead. questioning the mental maps we hold dear. and being willing to redraw them as needed.

Navigating with Awareness
Much like skilled sailors navigating the waters with an acute awareness of tides and winds. individuals and organizations need to craft strategies with a deep understanding of global currents and shifts. Where you eventually land is a result of both your goals and the global factors that either facilitate or hinder your journey.

Case in Point: The Oil Business

A look at the oil industry. where success is traditionally measured by rig count. reveals a critical mistake. Businesses often take one scenario. tweak it slightly. and convince themselves that they are working with different models. However. slight variations of a single view do not capture the diversity and unpredictability of the real world.

Learning from IBM

A picture from forecasting by an IBM leader. saying that PCs weren't a good enough market
IBM‚Äôs monumental miscalculation of the PC market potential‚Äîestimated at a few hundred thousand dollars. while the real value was a staggering $30 million‚Äîcost them dearly. The mental maps of their strategists. albeit successful in the past. failed to envision a scenario where PCs would be ubiquitous. missing out on a colossal opportunity and leaving an estimated $200 billion on the table - $100 billion for the software OS (Windows. then called MS-DOS) and $100 billion for the chip making market (that Intel captured)

Scenario Thinking: An Essential Tool
To prevent these decision traps. scenario thinking is invaluable. It helps to mitigate overconfidence. encourages outside-in thinking. enables seeing the full picture. corrects problem framing. and promotes asking the right questions. The goal is not to predict the future accurately but to ask better. more insightful questions. to prepare for a variety of possible futures.


Conclusion
Futurecasting. therefore. is a dance between confidence and humility. knowledge and curiosity. planning and flexibility. It's about continually asking "what if" and being prepared to redraw your mental maps to navigate the thrilling. unpredictable. and often unthinkable tides of the future. Let's escape the confines of our minds and be open to the vast. exciting possibilities the future holds.

Checkout this comprehensive analysis of various stakeholders. factors and strategic outcomes - link

If the very essence of employability is threatened then isn‚Äôt it important to talk about it?
And this time it is different. We talk about how technology shifts have been there. but this time its different. Today there are 78 million jobs that are vulnerable to be automated (IMF Report. 2021). And not enough non-routine. cognitive jobs being created (62mill) to fill this unemployment. gap(IMF Report. 2021). And lets take today‚Äôs discussion to talk about how this unfair wealth battlefield can be given its justice. It is currently important to study how this divide is ‚Äúcreated strongly due to technology‚Äôs impact on employability‚Äù.at this point time - and prepare ourselves for an ambiguous future

1. Job Displacement due to Automation
Automation has pierced through not just manufacturing sectors. but a vast array of industries. radically transforming the employment landscape. Far from being limited to routine and repetitive tasks. modern technological tools are expanding into spaces we once believed were uniquely human: content generation. graphic design. music composition. and even video editing.

Data Snapshot: Forecasts warn that a staggering 800 million workers worldwide could find their roles obsolete by 2030 due to automation. Furthermore. an alarming statistic states that 60% of all occupations have at least 30% of tasks that can be automated. signifying the breadth of the potential impact.
2. The Daunting Skills Gap
The velocity at which technology is advancing presents a conundrum. On one end. there's a surge in tech-centric roles. while on the other. there's a glaring skills deficit. This gap is even more pronounced among certain demographics: the elderly. individuals in rural settings. those encumbered by responsibilities. people with disabilities. immigrants. refugees. and professionals in non-tech domains.

Data Snapshot: The World Bank's 2020 report on the digital economy illuminated the magnitude of this disparity. noting that a mere 1% of Africa's workforce possesses ICT skills. Moreover. Deloitte's findings underline this crisis. with 64% of employees believing their organizations are unprepared to bridge this skills chasm. Adding fuel to the fire. only 17% of institutions are confident about having a future-ready workforce.
3. Escalating Income Inequality
The technological boom has inadvertently created a rift between high-skilled tech aficionados and low-skilled workers. As the former group reaps the benefits of a tech-driven economy. the latter. especially those susceptible to automation. grapples with stagnating or diminishing wages.

Data Snapshot: As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. the wage gap between those armed with a college degree and those with just a high school education has been expanding. The United Nations' ITU highlights another facet. pointing out that a lack of access to digital tools and the internet exacerbates income inequality.
4. Concentration of Wealth: The Tech Elites
It's undeniable that the tech era has given birth to a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals. This isn't just about riches but also the power and influence that come with such immense wealth. from influencing political decisions to shaping economic policies.

Data Snapshot: 2021 data reveals that the collective wealth of global billionaires skyrocketed to over $10 trillion. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. the ten wealthiest individuals added a colossal $450 billion to their coffers. To put this disparity into perspective. the top 1% of the global populace controls more than 44% of the world's wealth.
5. Gig Economy: Freedom or Feudalism?
The gig economy. bolstered by technology. promises flexibility and autonomy. Yet. it's essential to ponder whether it's a genuine avenue for empowerment or merely a modern form of feudalism. where workers. despite being 'connected'. remain isolated and vulnerable.

Data Snapshot: The gig ecosystem has witnessed explosive growth. with 36% of the U.S. workforce engaged in gig roles. cumulatively contributing to a market valued at $204 billion.
In synthesizing these insights. the digital age emerges as a paradox. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. it simultaneously casts shadows of inequality and uncertainty. As we navigate this era. it's paramount that stakeholders ‚Äì from governments to corporations to educators ‚Äì work in tandem to ensure that the digital future is inclusive. equitable. and just.

I did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software. This blog would be the story and the specifics of what a lot of people have asked me over the years. about how I made the switch and some things that you can use too. if you're interested in the same

I'll keep a major part of this blog very generic to the topic "switching streams" in general and then I'll add a section. at the end. about things I did.

Continuous learning is the name of the game
Today. learning anything is completely possible. at any given point. if you're willing to put in the work.

A lot of times we're under the notion that only a few people can learn a skillset based on the course they're "officially" enrolled in or some background experience they've had. I don't believe so. I think. that in this all-knowing YouTube and ever-improving-chatGPT era - anyone can learn anything from the Internet - for free. at their pace and convenience and from tonnes of world leading tutors.

Here are some pointers that might help you:

There is no magical playbook - to learn anything. it takes a lot of time and persistent effort of finding the right material for yourself and creating a roadmap for improving in the skill. So it's fine if you're not having a clear path to start with. There are a couple of channels that can give a clear path. but I think. that just starting from a Google or YouTube search about the topic name is a good place to start.
Taking notes really helps - Even if it's rough screenshots. scribbling random thoughts while learning or just copy-paste's of youtube videos - it works. I'm currently exploring YouTube video summarizer plugin in ChatGPT for this purpose. What's even better is revising and refining notes - for smarter reference later. It's like creating a power pellet from your learnings that you can consume at any point in the future to catch up on the skill super-fast. I used Notion for organizing whatever I've learnt into easily reference-able notes.
Motivation is 2/3rds of the game - Dedicate a fixed time slot for learning and keep struggling to make the most of it. Have very little ego. Initially you might suck - that's cool. But after breaking your head for about 1-2months. you'll not even realize but you'll naturally start seeing patterns and connections. That's the next level.
You shouldn't be afraid to suck at something new and give up if you struggle across even when understanding a paragraph of a new topic. Hell. when I was learning programming. it took me about 12hours to fully grasp and implement a 5 min youtube video about animation. But then. relentlessly pursuing on and on and on. I was able to condense 12 hr worth learnings into 5mins of revision through my notes. It's going to be hard. but if you just stick with it. it's going to be worth it.

The world is project-driven
We live in a fast paced world where most teams just look for how much value an individual can add to their team. If you've independently taught yourself and built impactful projects. no one really cares about your background coming from.

This can be harvested well to your benefit if you want to even your odds with those. who are already in the stream you like. Just build projects that rival with them. And these days YouTube has walkthroughs of any project across any stream for free - it's just so good.

Here are some key pointers to help you in this leg:

Projects are strong applications of learning - Project can mean anything - a tiny robot. a sketch. a basic app. a research paper commentary. a spreadsheet. ¬†a 5sec musical composition. a youtube video - anything. Point is - you're supposed ¬†to have employed your learnings and you're supposed to have worked super hard. It will help grasp the reason of each thing you thought was dumb but you read anyways and help translate it into moving parts of something very impactful
Start by copying other people's work - A good place to start is searching for existing projects on the internet and interpreting and recreating their work. Painters. musicians. writers. chefs - do it all the time while practicing - just patiently learning from the experience of others. This would help avoid pitfalls and learn best practices from your teachers. Again - don't just blind copy as they do. Refer - understand - try to recreate - fail - go back to refer- then understand - then try to recreate and so on.
Add your own flavor to each project - Employ a personalized touch to your project so that its unique. In the early days. I liked reading so when I came to programming projects - I would just add quotes of my favourite personalities in them as my touch. Now for you. it can be anything you like. but once you do this. you just differentiate extremely well from every other person who's just blind-copying and give a polished overall outcome
Tie the project to your ego - I get why this might be a double-edged sword but hear me out. Once you set a benchmark for the finished expectations from a project - tie it to the fact that it's something the world will see as a finished project from "you" and hence it can't fall below a certain quality threshold. For me. it used to motivate me to always push the project to completion and have it satisfy some baseline criteria.
Learn and grow with stakeholders - Some projects. you might not do alone and hence the coolest thing would be to learn from your collaborators and ensure they have a good experience working with you. Believe it or not. people and team skills are still one of the most important virtues for any team. Have fixed meetings. track your progress. hit your metrics and note down and share - what each of you learnt from the project. Projects offer collaborative opportunities and hence you can learn much beyond the books and the internet - you learn from people and in a lot of ways - what you learn will surprise you.
The more you passionately employ your learnings into real-time applications the more strongly your education will stick to you. ¬†

How to sell yourself
The next step after building projects is to share your work with the world and capitalize on it.

Few pointers on this are:

Have an online gallery - Every time you learn something. it would really help if you could maintain a online browsable gallery of your work. Be it your GitHub page or Dribbble gallery or LinkedIn profile or blog page. Just everytime you wrap up learning something. create an online snapshot for the world to view your thinking. approach. knowledge depth etc.
Look for interesting people and DM them: I used LinkedIn. Each time I found a person with interesting work - I would DM (Direct Message) them on LinkedIn and if possible. even get on a call to understand how they thought and learn from them. Seriously. it helps so much to get other people's feedback on your approach. Beyond this. there are obviously interesting conferences that you can just boldly sign up for. attend and be the newbie who talks and learns from everyone.
Confidence is free: In the early days in this new stream. you'll often feel imposter syndrome and underconfident - so start pretending otherwise. With time. it will grow into something more solid and with the knowledge and experience piling on. it would just compound. Confidence also helps express passion and clarity for the subject matter so the more you are confident about your projects and subject matter. the more people would value your work
I guess that about sums it up - in a nutshell - randomly search for ways to learn. iteratively keep sucking till you get better. build toy projects that make you happy and confidently talk about them on platforms. Rest. I'm 100% sure. the journey you take will help you figure out.

My story
Alright. now I'll be more specific about my story and things I did. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. thinking that a good college. a good job would be the only salvation. So naturally. once I got into the 4 year Civil Engineering program at IIT Madras. I thought that this would limit me from pursuing anything lateral. But in this internet-learning driven age. that's hardly the case.

To find what I liked - for a year. I dated a lot of career options - photo and videography. standup comedy. automotive engineering. consulting. designing. architecture and many countless others - mainly through hanging with different clubs of students in my college. ¬†Once I stumbled upon "software startups" I've just felt an irresistable pull to it. that stands to this day. Obviously there are a lot of days where I've doubted it too. but if it's your calling. some part of you always knows and gets attracted to it.

Now the specifics okay. I'll make it pointwise and list specific instructors and courses so that you can maybe check them out:

Disclaimer: You don't have to do it like me. Just read my opinion and do it the way most apt to you :)
I learnt the basics of programming in C Language from the hard copy book - How to C. by Prashant Kanetkar. It took me 4 months with my other college work helps understand the foundation of how a piece of code is designed. written. interpreted and executed.
Next 4 months. I learnt web development (HTML. CSS. JS) from DevEd. WebDevSimplified and Brad Traversy. I also use Laith Harb for time to time learning of new skills. Also. I used to build a lot of toy projects that these youtubers would post walkthrough videos of - this udemy course of 20 projects with Javascript is pretty sweet - link. Also learnt Git during this time
I used to also pursue first 2 hrs of any random long 7-8hr videos from FreeCodeCamp's youtube channel - anything from Data Structures and Algorithms to CyberSecurity to even color designing. I even did a bit of digital illustrations from from Gary Simon.
After this. I was consuming content and courses very fast. In the next 2months I learnt NodeJS. ¬†React and TypeScript. GraphQL. Docker and other misc topics. These are the most common industry technologies in use these days.
I even learnt basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and some Systems Designing from Algoexpert. A good place to start learning the basics of literally anything programming or computer related is Fireship - who does amazing 100second video intros of a tech.
From time to time. I've flirted with Machine Learning and AI courses from DeepLearning. ZeroToMastery and random blogs and projects and stuff. But these 2 sources are very strong for it
Next up. I was having trouble deploying apps and understanding large scale software so I studied systems designing from Gaurav Sen since it helps fall in love with the strength of computing. I also completed certifications from AWS. Google and Microsoft with the help of Stephane Mareek's amazing content
In fact. I feel that Stephane Mareek's course on Cloud Computing is a must-do for any software engineer to appreciate the beauty of internet and all cloud services that become the strong backbone of it. Just do this course. trust me.
Yeah and after that I got into generalist mindset and I was brushing up on everything from Figma for designing to Flutter for app development and was tinkering with over 10 frameworks and DevOps products at any given point for building great software.
To start getting more professional experience. I used to always offer myself up as a cheap developer to startups. I remember cold reaching out to 200+ engineers and founders (not HR since they have less of a say in hiring than actual engineers who lead teams) on linkedin over 4 months before I landed my 1st internship.
In startups. ¬†I could learn a lot everything about businesses - in the high-growth-vacuum environment that startups offer. Plus I made some money. re-invested that back in random tech-courses and business-books that I used to pick like a kid at a candy store and kept building and building a 2nd brain of mine in Notion.
I kept up my spirit and did create projects entirely from scratch on my own right after the 1st 6months even though they felt shitty and didn't work as well. Some. I couldn't even afford to keep running cause I would have to enter credit card details and I didn't have one back then. So I created YouTube videos or blog posts and shared the code as I sunsetted each project deployment. You can find a log here - link. Point is just keep trying honestly.

2nd brain in Notion
Yeah and after that I tried to run my own software startup. made some money and I failed to run it long term (here's the story of it - link).

I balanced all this work with college. Fun thing is. once you do projects. everyone wants to give you a shot - be it professors looking for programmers or startups looking for part-time developers.

A lot of times. people ask me how I managed my time or remembered so much. I do not. I just used "Google Calendar" and practiced using a lot of tools to keep reminding me to meet my goals and do my things. Every night before I go to sleep. I plan my next day's calendar for 10mins to be a good student. programmer. student-club head. brother. son. friend or any role that I feel is important dedicating my time to. Recently I even started to take Mondays to plan 3 to 4 most important things I wanted to achieve in each sphere of life in that week - like learning to cook. or reading a book. finishing an online course. deploying a project. teaching my mom about tech or even learning to play squash or salsa dancing with my friend - I tracked it all so I knew if I was missing out on time for any of my commitments.

My academics did take a hit no doubt - but I knew that I wasn't giving enough time to it and why I wasn't so it was cool.
Recently. I ended up applying to Carnegie Mellon University.

It took me a lot of research and advice - and I made this document to put down my thoughts. goals and opportunities - link. This was the single most important thing I did before choosing what I wanted to do next. I showed this doc to my seniors. people I knew and respected. family and friends and finally collated their advice into a decision.

For applying. here's all I did:

I gave the GRE test (325/340 with 4.5 in essay writing) and TOEFL test (111/120) though I didn't think GRE would have much weightage now. People say you gotta take paid courses and prep for 5 months and I don't believe it. Just mark your calendar. Go through this free material I aggregated in 2022. for GRE and TOEFL and you'll be able to get it done sooner.
Next. I talked a lot about my projects in my SoP. I wrote about majorly. creating impact through startups and software. you can give it a read - link.
My CGPA in academia was 8.01 out of 10 in my undergraduate college. I willingly didn't study as much in class or in pen-paper exams. But I pursued projects passionately and that's where I caught up on.
For Letters of Recommendation - 1. I got from the CEO/Founder 1st startup I worked with for 9months. Next. a letter from a Computer Science professor in my undergraduate whom I helped for free as a DevOps engineer on his logistics project. back in my 3rd year. I got my 3rd reco letter from my favourite Computer Science professor who had taught me 1 course (and that too I didn't score that well XD). but he just looked at my profile and work and decided to give me a shot. And yeah. that's where sometimes just asking gets you to. I just wrote him (and other profs too) an email and he called me for a 20min meeting and decided to help me out
I guess with all of that. I'm now headed for a Masters in Software Management to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I've messed up a lot. Have done a tonne of random things and kept exploring. Some of it worked. Most didn't.


In the end. I just have 1 advice - read a lot of opinions to expand your world view but at the end. internalize all that info with with what feels right in your heart. and trust me. just fuck it and do it.

Here's just a basic email thread exchange I had with 1975 passed-out alumni of Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) - exchanging talks about the way things are at IITM right now in 2023 vs in 1970. What ensued were views about IIT Madras and India in the 1970s. This is a fun anecdotal blog that tells 2 stories from different ages and how. from studying what happens in India's colleges. we can study the broader outlook of technological progress in the nation

1970s
Following is the message from an alum - Sudhir Krishna who passed out in the 1970s

B.Tech was a 5-year program. ¬† Half of the first year was spent toiling in the workshops wearing khaki uniform. ¬† The curriculum was course-heavy: ¬†Usually had 7 courses per semester. and reached 8 courses in the 7th semester (4th year). ¬† Continuous contact hours from 8 AM to 4:15 PM (with lunch from noon to 1:15 PM). ¬† ¬†Not much free time for creative projects except in the final (10th) semester. ¬† ¬†The German collaboration was still evident and some German faculty were still around. ¬† The campus population (students. faculty. administrators. staff) was much smaller than it is now. ¬† ¬†We all had single rooms in hostels. ¬† The annual cultural festival Mardi Gras was started and has now become Saarang (right?). ¬† ¬†Students were multi-talented -- academics. music. chess. bridge. quiz. drama/ acting. mimicry. sports. literary activities. etc. ¬† I myself was captain of the institute chess team. member of the institute tennis team for a couple of years. won the institute debate contest one year. represented IIT-M at the cultural festivals of other IITs. and became Under Officer in NCC Air Wing.
Also. back in the 1970s. India was still a poor country with a socialist economy. ¬† The country's global image was associated with poverty. backwardness. ¬† Only some American universities and companies were aware of the IIT brand. most notably Harvard Business School (where I got my MBA) and management consulting firms like McKinsey. ¬† Even back then. HBS admissions officers said they viewed IIT B.Techs the same way they did MIT and Caltech undergrads. ¬† But they made fun of Indian typewriters that were used for completing the application forms

I received an invitation from McKinsey for an interview that began with "Because of your Indian Institute of Technology background......."

2023
I recently graduated from IIT Madras. The hostel sector is quite lush with trees starting to form canopies above. The monkeys are not only more in number now. but more in daring as well. They're smart. bold and know how to work the system to get what they want.

The academics are strong and flexible with students having the option to pursue whatever they want. irrespective of their BTech department. A lot of application and project based courses have sprung up where we do assignments and mini-projects as opposed to just written exams.

Students are a lot in number now and it's fun to see everyone put honest hard work in their passions - right from technology and sciences to art. music. comedy and gaming. You find people of all interests and talents. The labs and workshop are still hands-on. though only about 40% of what it used to be in the 1970s. The departments have also developing into independent schools of specialization on their own with tonnes of activities. projects. lectures. events. yearly festival and more. In fact. the new department called "Engineering Design" - (near Velachery Gate) offers a lot of product designing and entrepreneurship encouragement in both- ¬†hardware and software. There's the department for management studies. humanities and flexibility of leveraging online platforms like NPTEL (https://nptel.ac.in) apart from attending in-person classes.

Here's my favourite part - the student-run project lab - Center for Innovation at IIT Madras - has over 20 teams and a 2 storey cool building. each one tinkering in topics all the way from AI. robotics. app development and racecar engg to energy efficiency. rocketry. product designing and rural tech (check this for more - https://blog.techsoc.iitm.ac.in/tech-iitm-in-5-mins/). So I'd say recovering from the pandemic. projects are at a powerful high

Hostel culture also seems to be re-igniting. guess a lot of it got hit during the pandemic years but teams like Schroeter. LitSoc and TechSoc are putting the fire back in. Athletics is strong and we won 1st in Men's championship and 4th overall in Inter IIT Sports Meet. We bagged 6 medals in Inter IIT Tech Meet (Golds in AI and entrepreneurship) and came 3rd in Inter IIT Cultural Meet.

In a nutshell. IITM has become the perfect home for pursuing anything passionately
Speaking of animals - monkeys are ruling the hostels so much so that we get a complaint email about monkey assault every week or 2. They're bold and smart and compete for food. ¬†The deer and blackbuck population is also fair and we do hangout with them in lawns sometimes. Dogs were actually moved out of the campus in 2019 since they used to hunt deer. There's a species of red ants we see all the time and snakes are barely spotted once or twice a year during rains. if anytime. Funnily. scorpions are seen near admin buildings and hostels sometimes
Workshops are lighter and we have much more time for creative activities. If you can think of it. there's a club for it working passionately.
On nearby places - Right now. Taramani is still go to for tea. snacks and cigarettes and food delivery orders. There are 2 cycle repair shops in insti. We get great breeze. most likely attributed to the greenery since the construction has blocked out the sea breeze. Student's these days hang out mostly around a huge mall outside Velachery. the food shops along the 100 ft. Road outside Taramani. Elliot's and Marina beach. Chetpet Eco-park this place called "Hidden Lake". Tada waterfalls in Andhra. and Westin bar (if you have money :)). But insti itself is I think the most happening place for so many technical. sport and cultural things that folks barely step out.
On innovation- Self-innovation and Entrepreneurship is being spearheaded by the new Director - Professor Kamakoti. In collaboration with Indian government. Professor Prabhu Rajagopal and his team - is doing several things to help students build products and eventually. companies. In fact. a couple of companies like Ather. HyperVerge. Solinas Integrity - born right inside IIT Madras - are making waves. Most recently Clueso got funded by YCombinator in 2023 and it furthered more students to do this.
On inside insti ¬†- The Dhaba outside Saras is now a full-fledged restaurant with all kinds of Indian food. juices and snacks. It's currently managed by the caterer - Zaitoon - but the tender is open for bids every 3 years. We had to recently monkey proof it due to the stealing incidents XD. The first floor of this is converted into a colorful place with a large television screen for student clubs to sit and ideate. Mummy Daddy Andhra mess outside Taramani is our go-to place for Biryani. Our tuition fees. without scholarship. are now INR 1.00.000 and hostel fees is INR 26.000 for each semester. The hostel bonding. as Srikanth said. is more shifted to clubs and messes are detached from hostels. This has helped in knowing a lot more breadth-wise bonding.
A lot of construction is going on now. There are 2 new Academic complexes. And a new sports complex is being made near the tennis courts
IIT Madras is a lot more creative. entrepreneurial. ¬† Its population is much larger. ¬† The post-graduate programs have grown a lot. ¬† Admissions quotas based on caste and gender have made the student population more diverse. ¬†(We had very few women during our time.) ¬† The IIT brand name is now world renowned. but still based largely on its undergrad B.Tech program and not yet for post-graduate and research programs. ¬† IIT alumni have distinguished themselves in America and reached the highest levels in industry and academia.

Also. India as a country has changed. ¬† It is capitalistic. entrepreneurial and technologically advanced. ¬† The country's nominal GDP is world #5 and projected to become world #3 by 2028. ¬† PM Modi. in my opinion. is a superstar on the global stage and gets royal treatment wherever he goes. ¬† Geopolitically. India is viewed as a counterweight to China. ¬† This is shaping up to be a China-India century and will be very evident by 2050. ¬† As for IITs. there are 23 of them now. ¬† While the 5 original IITs still rank at the top in India. some of the newer IITs are establishing niches of excellence for themselves. ¬†IIT Madras is ranked at the top.

Attaching a couple videos and pictures of campus here for your reference
Checkout these videos:

Fruit juices are still cheap. Canteens still open till 3am. Sunlight still glitters through trees. Students still mess around but have that drive to innovate and lastly - friendships are still stupid and meaningful.

I recently graduated from Indian Institute of Technology. Madras. Here's 8 lessons I learnt from my 8 semesters and stories of how I learnt them so this is not some lame vanity post.


July 2019. entering college
Semester 1: It's a big world and trying everything. even lying outside your comfort zone is free. Be open to talk to everyone and make tonnes of friends. Semester 8 will teach you why its important. I picked up this lesson while borrowing 300 from a hostel guard to pay for pizza at 3am. attempting failed jokes at open mics and also while countlessly sitting in club orientations. It's always a good time to suck at new things :)


Semester 2: It's college. you can sign up for tonnes of things and asking anyone for help is free - people genuinely want to help. I learnt this while being disciplined and trained by the legends of the Raftar Formula Racing team as we championed 3 national trophies against all odds. Discipline and accountability take passion and convert it into wonders.


Semester 3: Just build projects that teach you skills you find cool. Persistence and hard work will help you trump all odds to be good at what you love. Maintaining motivation is 2/3rds of the game. Sitting in a COVID ridden world. using my neighbour (Jay Bafna's) WiFi to learn software development and making dumb projects like todo apps taught me that just inching a little closer to ambition. Preferably start an online presence of you that tracks your work well - write about your work and share


Semester 4: At this point. I'd say start taking bets on yourself and bold risks is the best - you're young - what's the worst that could happen? I learnt this core lesson when I decided to leave home and work at Farmako (YC S20) with a different set of legends. Having very little resources and pure hunger to survive and succeed over 9 months taught me a lot about the brilliant impact a small determined set of people can have on the world. Be stupid. take more bets. You're young and smart - you'll figure it out


Semester 5: You'll see a world of people who seem to have figured it out and gotten it right. But most of us are just winging it. I'd say at this point. just being real with a couple friends and still believing and taking bets is the hard path. I personally learnt it through shit tonne of mistakes. self-doubt and pain and tears that 2 things in life mattered - I was working on something I cared about. and I was around people I loved. I follow this principle to date. Not caring about a lot of external stimuli is a superpower you can acquire by just self-assessing.


Semester 6: You're growing now. Tension is building up and you're probably expected to have figured out life. You don't. In fact it's a good thing if you've failed over 3-4 times by now - it means you're trying and getting back-up enough. Having a vague idea of how you want to spend time - that's something I'd recommend having. A good idea here is take up something. and no matter how much it pains. see it through completion. Working with Logistics Lab. IIT Madras and Coursepanel taught me that enduring and reaching the finish line is way more important than procastinating for perfection or giving up midway. That's a major differentiating factor too.


Semester 7: You're probably multi-tasking at this point. Become boring. routine-driven - use a calendar and documentation tools to string multiple tracks together. Write a lot - it helps unclutter the mind and think clearly. I know it's boring but having control over how your time. energy and money flows by writing stuff down goes a long way. It helps aim long for a year and piece it down to what you and your team need to do today. I learnt this while helping Institute Technical Society (TechSoc). IIT Madras frame its vision from to 1700+ participants. 14 events and countless projects. I learnt that small tasks with directed effort moves mountains.


Semester 8: It's your turn to give back now. Now your old friendships will blossom and it's time to be ready for new ones. Be there as a mentor your junior self would have appreciated. Preferably take up a position of responsibility that's undervalued and difficult and lead a team through and through. no matter what it costs. I think the Inter IIT Technical Meet at Indian Institute of Technology. Kanpur where we went from stranded on a railway station to nailing medals in Kanpur (2000 miles away) in under 40 hours.


Most lessons are not my own and have been taught to me by amazing amazing mentors. friends. family members and I'm undeniably grateful to.

This blog won't solve your problems - hell. mine also took a fuckload of meanderings before I got to understand them. Think of it as more like - not repeating my fuckups. College is a mix of confusion and opportunities. wins and losses - in a short time frame so screw everything and feel free to ping me anytime if you're going through something and need a ear. Listen to all this - but the best part is - don't do it like me. do it like you. üòâ

Machine Learning projects may seem complicated at first glance. but in reality. they follow a systematic flow that. once understood. makes the whole process quite straightforward. In this blog. we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.

Let's first sing a song to kickoff this blog


In a nutshell. what are we gonna talk about
It's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section. I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead. I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!


Steps of ML
0. Become One with the Data
The initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data. identifying potential outliers. and understanding the relationship between different variables.

1. Preprocessing Your Data
Raw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning. normalization. and standardization of values.

When dealing with large datasets. it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as "batches". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor. and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.

2. Creating a Model
Starting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A "baseline" is a relatively simple. existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress. you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.

3. Compiling and Fitting the Model
Once you have decided on your model. the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function. optimizer. and the evaluation metrics. After compiling. fit your model to the training data. allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.

4. Evaluating the Model
After your model has been fitted. it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
In order to improve the model's performance. you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.

Remember. overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting. consider using techniques such as data augmentation. regularization layers. or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.

6. Iterate Until Satisfied
The above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.

8. Explore Advanced Techniques for Improvement
Once you have beaten your baseline. you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model. training for a longer period. finding an ideal learning rate. using more data. or using transfer learning.

Deep Diving into templates and tricks
Processing the Data
The first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it. thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data. where actions such as rotating. flipping. and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.

Shuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset. such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training. consider shuffling your data.

When processing your data. you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:

StandardScaler can give each feature zero-mean and unit standard deviation.
MinMaxScaler provides a non-distorting. light-touch transformation.
RobustScaler is useful for reducing the influence of outliers.
Normalizer provides row-based normalization. using l1 or l2 normalization.
Refer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.

Start with a Baseline
Starting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:

Creating a model: Define the input. output. and hidden layers of a deep learning model.
Compiling a model: Define the loss function. optimizer. and evaluation metrics for the model.
Fitting a model: Train the model to find patterns between features and labels.
Baseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. based on your project's requirements.

PyTorch
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Set the number of epochs (how many times the model will pass over the training data)
epochs = 100

# Create empty loss lists to track values
train_loss_values = []
test_loss_values = []
epoch_count = []

# Put data on the available device
# Without this. error will happen (not all model/data on device)
X_train = X_train.to(device)
X_test = X_test.to(device)
y_train = y_train.to(device)
y_test = y_test.to(device)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    ### Training

    # Put model in training mode (this is the default state of a model)
    model_0.train()

    # 1. Forward pass on train data using the forward() method inside 
    y_pred = model_0(X_train)
    # print(y_pred)

    # 2. Calculate the loss (how different are our models predictions to the ground truth)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred. y_train)

    # 3. Zero grad of the optimizer
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # 4. Loss backwards
    loss.backward()

    # 5. Progress the optimizer
    optimizer.step()

    ### Testing

    # Put the model in evaluation mode
    model_0.eval()

    with torch.inference_mode():
      # 1. Forward pass on test data
      test_pred = model_0(X_test)

      # 2. Caculate loss on test data
      test_loss = loss_fn(test_pred. y_test.type(torch.float)) # predictions come in torch.float datatype. so comparisons need to be done with tensors of the same type

      # Print out what's happening
      if epoch % 10 == 0:
            epoch_count.append(epoch)
            train_loss_values.append(loss.detach().numpy())
            test_loss_values.append(test_loss.detach().numpy())
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch} | MAE Train Loss: {loss} | MAE Test Loss: {test_loss} ")
Tensorflow
# Now our data is normalized. let's build a model to find pattern

# Set a random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# 1. Create a model
model_2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28.28)).
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10. activation="softmax").
])

# 2. Compile the model
model_2.compile(
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy().
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam().
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# 3. Train the model
norm_history = model_2.fit(
    train_data_norm.
    train_labels.
    epochs = 10.
    validation_data = (
        test_data_norm.
        test_labels
    )
)
Plotting training and testing loss
## Plotting training and test loss

# Plot the loss curves
plt.plot(epoch_count. train_loss_values. label="Train loss")
plt.plot(epoch_count. test_loss_values. label="Test loss")
plt.title("Training and test loss curves")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.legend();
Evaluating Our Model
Visualizing our model's predictions and its performance metrics is an integral part of model evaluation. Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems. evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.

Tracking Experiments
Visualizing our model's predictions
Apart from that. a good way to proceed is visualize. visualize. visualize!

It's a good idea to visualize

The data - What data are we working with? What does the data look like?
The model itself - what does our model look like
The training of a model - How does a model perform as it is learning?
The predictions of the model -How do the predictions match up against the ground truth (the original labels)
To visualize our model's predictions. it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values

def plot_predictions(train_data=X_train. 
                     train_labels=y_train. 
                     test_data=X_test. 
                     test_labels=y_test. 
                     predictions=None):
  """
  Plots training data. test data and compares predictions.
  """
  plt.figure(figsize=(10. 7))

  # Plot training data in blue
  plt.scatter(train_data. train_labels. c="b". s=4. label="Training data")
  
  # Plot test data in green
  plt.scatter(test_data. test_labels. c="g". s=4. label="Testing data")

  if predictions is not None:
    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)
    plt.scatter(test_data. predictions. c="r". s=4. label="Predictions")

  # Show the legend
  plt.legend(prop={"size": 14});
To efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations. it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.

Improving Our Model
Build the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....

Improving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation. compilation. and training stages.

During the model creation stage. you might add more layers. increase the number of hidden units in each layer. or change the activation function. In the compilation stage. changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.

This process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as "hyperparameter tuning".

Approaches to improve accuracy

Get more data -> Get a larger dataset that we can train our model on
Hyperparameter tuning -> Use more hidden layers or increase number of neurons in each hidden layer
Train for longer -> Give your model more of a chance to find patterns in the dataset
Save a Model
Saving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment. like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow. depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch. the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().

PyTorch code
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Create models directory 
MODEL_PATH = Path("models")
MODEL_PATH.mkdir(parents=True. exist_ok=True)

# 2. Create model save path 
MODEL_NAME = "01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth"
MODEL_SAVE_PATH = MODEL_PATH / MODEL_NAME

# 3. Save the model state dict 
print(f"Saving model to: {MODEL_SAVE_PATH}")
torch.save(obj=model_0.state_dict(). # only saving the state_dict() only saves the models learned parameters
           f=MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
Run on GPU
Running your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function. where device is set to "cuda" for GPU or "cpu" for the Central Processing Unit.

Conclusion
In conclusion. understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively. Remember. machine learning is an iterative process. and it's okay to go back and forth between steps to improve your model's performance.

Introduction
As we progress in the age of digital transformation. organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework. an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda. is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management. which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless. and how does it function? In this blog. we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.

What is AWS Serverless Framework and How is it Helpful?
The Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes. either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda. you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.

Installing Node.js and Python on Your MacOS Machine
Before we start with the Serverless framework. we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.

To install Node.js. we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:

brew install node

For Python. MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However. it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:

brew install python

To verify successful installation. type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.

Setting Up AWS and Serverless CLI on MacOS Machine
After installing Node.js and Python. it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:

npm i -g serverless

Upon installation. verify the version using serverless -v command.

To deploy your functions on AWS. you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command. replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin

How to Invoke. Deploy. and See Logs of Serverless Lambda Functions
To create a new service or function. use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example. to create a Python service:

sls create --template aws-python --path myService

To deploy this function to AWS. use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only. use sls deploy function -f functionName.

To test a function on AWS. use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.

What is AWS SAM and How to Set it Up on MacOS
AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions. APIs. databases. and event source mappings.

To install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS. first. install the AWS CLI:

brew install awscli

Next. install AWS SAM:

brew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli

Initialize a new SAM application using sam init. choose your desired runtime (e.g.. Python). and template. To build your application. navigate to the project directory and use sam build.

You can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API. you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.

To deploy your application. use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke "FunctionName".

If you need to delete your stack for any reason. you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.

You can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode. click on "Add Debug Configuration" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.

For Python packages management. you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.

Conclusion and Why Serverless is Useful for Cost-Saving
As you can see. the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating. deploying. and managing serverless applications. Moreover. by leveraging these tools. we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.

Serverless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage. it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions. which leads to significant cost savings. especially for applications with variable workloads.

We hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.

TechSoc IIT Madras was one of the most stressful and fulfilling decisions I made in my last year in institute. We upscaled the tech culture at the institute through organizing 20+ competitions. 15+ guest lectures - resulting in 22
products. events impacting 2000+ students. I‚Äôd personally recommend this to any person who shares these 2 traits -

passion of driving a solid tech culture at our university
willingness to test their limits to stand for something bigger than themselves
I‚Äôll talk mainly about 6 things about my tenure as TechSoc Head from 2022 to 2023. where we captured the engagement of over 2000+ students. having conducted 15+ guest lectures and 20+ technical events.

The Initiatives
The Experience
The Growth
The De-merits
A crazy story
Cool stuff I got to do
FYI - Although this blog is all motivational stuff. we failed a tonne of times. but we did end up making people smile and make amazing things - and that's what it's all about.

The initiatives
My approach was and always has been - invest in the team. then invest in the customer and then invest in the future. The fun part about this 3 step process is the more you invest in the earlier phases. you're actually also investing well enough in the latter parts.

Investing in the team
The most important part was always that each member on the team felt proud and challenged and happy about the work we did. They had to grow. they had to be happy and challenge their own problem solving skills - else it wasn't worth it.

So here are a couple things I tried and liked:


not the full team. some suckers missed picture day
A training period
Spent atleast a month for new joinees to get used to "entrepreneurial activities" - like studying companies. making presentations and pitching. drafting detailed reports. running collaborative projects. cold emailing. corporate relations. This helped the team learn a lot in a short period of time and gain confidence.

Here's a syllabus if it helps - link

But yeah. if you want top-quality. hard-working. smart people actually working with you on your vision - gotta train your army to fight. You can start by defining the vision of your team. and what culture you want to carry into this.

Meeting structuring
College is a complex time with lotta priorities. commitments and spontaneous plans. It is important to have a definite meeting structure so that you stay consistent and add a punctuality aspect to respect everyone's time.

If anyone came late. they bought ice-cream to everyone who came before.
If the meeting didn't end on time. then I would buy ice-cream for everyone in the meeting
Every meeting had a document and actionables that people could take back so we always met with a direction. discussed agenda as per time and walked away with usable data and direction.
This structure is something I learned from Sharavanakumar at Khatabook and to this day. I'm grateful for it.

OKRs
OKRs - helping break down the overall vision into just 3 things each of the 18 of us had to get right each week - while working with each other. We were 18 disruptors - 54 things per week. pointing in 1 direction - helped us grow like crazy.

Team Happiness and Culture
At TechSoc. you always get a birthday cake. If you're in person - team folks even show up for your celebration at 12AM. We ensured that in our weekly retros. we had shoutouts for everyone who did great work in that week. Every event we saved on. the surplus would go back to team treats and gifting goodies. We were transparent about our money and trusted each other with it. Apart from that. we'd enjoy late night sessions on the lawns playing games (Mafia. Truth and Dare. "Albatross") or singing or sharing stories about ourselves.

Investing in the experience

give them pizza. they will build amazing things
Every event at TechSoc was a collaboration with another technical team on campus. And they're usually busy with projects but do want the publicity on campus. Every meeting we had with them. went as follows:

Why are we doing this event? What do we want to takeback from it
What does the event do? What's the best date and why?
How will the overall flow of conducting look like?
How do we market it?
What do we need (human resources and props) to run it successfully?
What are some loopholes we should consider when organizing this?
Metrics tracking and SWOT analysis
All this information would then be captured in a document - sample. This document would contain all the plan. the necessary links and people collaborating on it.

On ground. here are some values we ensured each time we conducted the event

Participant is god. If it means you're cycling with one hand and doing repeated samosa deliveries. sticking posters everywhere or ensuring that they have water - you gotta do it.
TechSoc never gives up. No matter how much things screw-up. And they did. like. all the time. Once there was an internet issue in a seminar we were streaming while a billion dollar CEO waited on the other end. But we recouped and did the damn thing
After-event work happens super fast. Everything from prizes. to score updation. to social media. website updating and everything.
Investing in the big picture

Mandakini hostel team. who made a car that did obstacle detection realtime
"Always build on top of your previous work". A lot of what we did at TechSoc compounded in on itself over time. We started with arguing and justfying INR 7000 rupee budgets for paper plane events and in 1 year got to INR 1.5 lakh AI hackathons. The way to do this was:

Update the fricking website - ensure that the overall presence of TechSoc was always up to date with everything that we had achieved so other people could review. With time. as we did more things. we became more awesome and it kept compounding with time. This helped get external attention and investment as well.
Build extensive documentation - Every document. going in. with time. created such a strong clarity and database - everything from important contacts to event documents and plans and costs and the whole thing - just mind-blowing. It helped a lot of people collaborate and introspect and evolve work with time.
Align everyone. Repeatedly - Every meeting. or party. or failure point - it was super important to just tell everyone what we stand for.
The Experience
Technical Society is a relatively growing student body and so the job is obviously hard. The place my team had to start from was how to even get 5 people to show up for an offline event when we were reeling back from the pandemic. Key points of my experience are:


the aero contingent team from our university (L to R - Akshat. Ayush. Pranit. Reddy Anna. my Alak boi. Sukriti)
It‚Äôs a fricking rollercoaster - There are events that go super well and then there are others where 0 people show up. My highs were really high and lows were equally painful. I‚Äôve wanted to quit and dump so many times but then there were equally balanced nights of euphoria and adrenaline
It‚Äôs about the team- Investing in the team‚Äôs growth during the summer following my recruitment was one of the best decisions I made. Because this strong loyal team stood while we encountered multiple hits over failed early events in the first semester. And now I see the same shy-to-even-turn-on-their-video-camera students stay up 14 straight hours. jugaading food and leading the conduction of tech events on campus.
Diplomacy is everything - I‚Äôve had to be nice in multiple f-you conversations and taken a lot of sit from multiple participants and stakeholders at a lot of points. Being rational more than emotional. knowing the right words to pitch to the right decision maker for an approval. collaborating with other student bodies for mutual vision alignment - that kind of thing
The tech community has heart - Tech-community is introverted. reserved and fit the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù description (barring a few outliers). But these are the same people who will pour their heart out for finessing a project - right from scribbling on whiteboards to presenting products. stand by and help each other for free. bond over late night tea conversations and pizzas. fight when they‚Äôre sleep deprived and drive real impact to push the society forward. This inspirational set of people is worth fighting for
The Growth
Gigantic network - This is the most golden essence of being in an technology college. I reached out far and wide:

interacted and connected with the most passionate tech enthusiasts across all domains at my university
connected to nationwide college's top talent through a joint Tech board
became part of a top class university entrepreneur community
multiple companies (GitHub. Unacademy) that sponsored our events
Being a better planner - Every TechSoc event had to be granularly figured out - right from the why. to the domain. to the logistics (approvals. finances. food). marketing plans. grading patterns. feedback loop and process documentation. And prior to that - figuring out which initiatives to run for which target audience and how that tied into the TechSoc vision to provide something to students that they were missing out on.

TechSoc taught me about this more than anything. You have to be a better planner than you ever were when you‚Äôre handling over 5 Lakhs of budget and getting around 30-40 things right in stressful weeks.

Becoming a stronger person - A leader is looked up to be a responsible and strong person. But no one is born that way. You learn by getting hit with a brick in the face. I learnt to be resilient. have more patience. lose the fear of crowd handling. stand my ground in hard negotations. take in a lot of negative feedback and deal with some failures. There were a lot of times when I felt like running away from the problem but the beauty of this PoR is that it won‚Äôt let you. Even when you‚Äôre tired. or tied by administration or resource constrained and super close to giving up. It has definitely increased my self-confidence to stand up to any problem in the world with a - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre TechSoc. we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù attitude.

Being part of something bigger - I had a chance to stand for a strong tech culture at my college - even though it sometimes meant being unhealthily altruistic. Looking back. I‚Äôll have not regretted that I spent my last year complaining about not having a strong tech scene at univer. I‚Äôll carry with me the legacy of having led highly passionate believers who wanted to push the limits of what technology can be.

The De-merits

passing out after 40hrs on non stop competition work and logistics
Constantly stressed - In the early days. especially with the offline shift and even during the competitions. I felt responsible for too many things. It‚Äôs an unprecedented level of stress - that no one should rationally take. Passion might be good reason to do it. but not otherwise. You‚Äôre worried for an event. a team member‚Äôs growth. someone resigning. some plan getting delayed and simultaneously 0 participation in another event on the next day. Since the team is small. unlike other bodies. you‚Äôre involved personally in most things and while the growth is good - the cost it comes at. is also high
Personal sacrifices - Barely any time on most weekends. I remember just bouncing across meetings post 8pm on a lot of weekdays and then standing by the team. I‚Äôve missed a lot of social life. sometimes even personal goals (heck. I didn‚Äôt work on my startup during national competitions) and relaxing. as I struggled to move the needles of 3 different verticals whilst the cores were still warming up. The role does take a lot out of you and it‚Äôs not a good thing always.
A lot of ground-work - My leadership style has always been more hands-on. Might be a good or bad thing. I don‚Äôt know the balance. There are days when people won‚Äôt work upto your standards and you‚Äôll have to step in and help even though you really are just mad and might want to panic and yell at them to get it done. Compassion taught me to share the load - right from being a TShirt distributor to a sweeper to poster designer to food delivery agent.
A crazy story
I'll tell a story of how I learnt persistence. In 2023. I was leading a 90 member contingent from our university to participate in Inter IIT Tech Meet (a national level competition for solving technical challenges). I was managing 15 projects over 2 months and was also in charge of the logistics. travel and accommodation in Kanpur. I booked the train tickets for my contingent through our institute and they assured us of tickets to Kanpur. However. in on the day of travel. amidst 100+ things I juggled all the way upto the train station. I realized that our tickets from Chennai to Kanpur were waitlisted. The train was full and keeping in mind the safety of my team. I told them to get off and said we'd find another way. And so. this story begins with a huge group ¬†of people. staring down at me at 12am on a railway station. with hopes that I'd get them to our competition - 2000 miles away - in the next 36 hours.

I arranged for a bus back to the campus and stayed up till 3. trying to figure out how I'd get my team to Kanpur safely. with the limited budget I had. For context. our institute had a no-flight refund policy for competitions. We brainstormed multiple routes via permutations of bus and train but we'd reach late and fatigued. At 3:15am. Shreepoorna found a reasonable flight ticket deal from Chennai to Delhi. At 3:30am. I poured in all my personal savings of about INR 85000 (with a INR 10000 loan) and booked the tickets to Kanpur. Here's the celebration video of that too.


the moment the tickets for kanpur were booked at 3:30am (gut feeling- all these people are going to make great founders 1 day)
Next. I spent 2 hours breaking it to the 2 people. whose tickets couldn't be booked due to limited funds. At 4am. I was standing at Cauvery Hostel. getting rattled by a junior on how I'd failed my entire purpose as a leader. Returning to my room in a mess. I wrote a long email to the Dean. explaining the situtation before I passed out.

After a 1 hr nap. I woke up in cold sweats. informing our Dean with a long email - the entire situation. 9am. I showed up to their office. shaking. But the admin rallied with us and with their support. got the tickets for the remaining team as well.

After 2 hours we flew to Delhi. In-flight. I worked with the people solving the "entrepreneurship challenge" and got their submission right. Abhishek Gupta (on campus) was making the pitch deck all the way to 12 when we submitted it. before we finally got kicked out of the cafe we made our makeshift office. with just a single coffee order. Next. at Delhi. we haggled and arranged bus transport to Kanpur for all with a 40% discount. Turns out. back then. online bookings weren't considered valid and you had to physically haggle and get people in the bus.

Fun fact. we got screwed over by the bus guys who dropped us about 25km away and once again. stranded on a highway at 7am. our team is bargaining with auto drivers to get us there.

Finally. after the entire long journey. we reached Kanpur campus 10 hours before time. 24 hours after that. with a parched throat. I pitched and won the silver medal for my college at the entrepreneurship challenge. Oh and the savings I put in? I got them reimbursed a month later by tweaking around my cloud provider SaaS costs and showing AWS credits as expenditure (technically. I did lose the money).

This is my favourite story that I like to share as I can neither put it in my resume nor will it be a conventional interview question - but it is so fundamental to my way of working - Persistence. I'd rather sweat in a garage than recline in a cabin. Cause where other's see unconvention. I see genius. "Ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. are the ones who really do"

Here's another story blog I wrote about an initiative TechSoc created and ran - to motivate students to believe and build projects - link

Okay so this post is not actually about college ragging but majorly about Retrieval Generated Augmentation (RAG). a cool machine learning and indexing application I came across while building CloudPilot - "the copilot for cloud engineers"

What is CloudPilot? ‚úàÔ∏è
CloudPilot was a project we built with the vision of going from idea to cloud within 10 minutes.

The goal of the project was to enable any thinker to start with a business problem. quickly to research and come up with a wholesome engineering document that had the solution approach. its architecture and performance analysis done well in under 10 minutes.

This product was built at a hackathon in under 24 hours. Let me know if there are any improvements you want me to look at.

And with that. let's dive in. into the product flow



What does a cloud engineer do?
First. let's understand how cloud architects function and come up with infrastructure solutions for a given business problem. See. as a typical cloud architect - the flow is as follows

Step 0: - It starts with a problem statement such as a architecture for payment gateway or a data migration pipeline or a high availability server fleet setup.
Step 1: Ask the right questions - Several times. we go back and forth with the problem statement to understand what are the exact business requirements and what are important aspects that we need to optimize for.
Step 2: Research - With the given requirements. the standard approach is to go online. read up some blogs by cloud providers. read case studies and open source articles to get context and understand our problem statement. Here. typically a lot of time is just spent in finding the right article. Most software problems have precedents that have solved the requirement wholly or in parts. Hence. finding the right documentation for similar requirements is of paramount importance.
Step 3: Technical Requirements - Once we have asked the right questions. we prepare a brief technical document. highlighting the most important performance expectations from the software and then start researching what kind of cloud offerings do we require. We also quantify that to what extent do we want to look at satisfying a particular goal. eg: 500 TB of storage. 80ms latency in communication. 7 0s of availability. 8GB GPUs for ML training.
Step 4: List the building blocks - Here. we simply map each techinal requirement to an existing cloud service we can use and do a comparative analysis. If it's ML. it's gotta be Google Cloud. for availability and cost. it's gotta be AWS - that kinda thing. So we start listing cloud offerings such as EC2 (AWS). Maps API (Google Cloud) or Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Azure). We think of using these offerings as builing blocks for the entire architecture and justify why the offering is important
Step 5: Join the blocks - Here. we join together the building blocks as services that communicate with 1 another and draw a systems diagram that helps to understand how the overall system works. Which part does what function and how it's role fits into the overall requirement.
Step 6: Iterate - Once an end-to-end flow is ready. we do overall Product. Engineering and Cost Analysis and then we iterate upon the design to optimize for certain aspects - make it faster. make it cheaper. increase the storage. increase the redundancy - that kind of thing. And based on that. we improve the choice of building blocks and integrating them together in 1 system
Step 7: Templatize - Once a cloud architecture is ready. we start looking at using Cloud templates such as CloudFormation by AWS. Terraform by Hashicorp to easily just deploy the entire architecture and have a skeleton of it functional to understand performance on a practical level.
Thus. this is the overall flow of the entirety of coming up with a cloud architecture. Beautiful and methodical.

So if we were to copilotize this process we would need an AI agent who could read through all cloud architecture related blogs. docs. case-studies like an engineer and intuitively go through steps 1 to 8 and help arrive upon a solution.

And that's why we used something called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique where we retrieved the right list of documents from the internet and asked our Large Language Model to generate an answer from text that it studied from these docs.

Before we segway into what we did. let's study in short - what is this "Retrieval Augmented Generation" anyways?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)


Imagine you're a chef and you're trying to create a new dish. First. you go to your pantry (which has a vast array of ingredients). This is akin to the retrieval part. You take a look at different recipes you have used in the past or a recipe book for ideas. You fetch or 'retrieve' ingredients and inspiration based on these recipes.

Next. you start to combine these ingredients together. perhaps in a way you've never done before. You might modify some of the recipes to match your taste or to make the dish unique. This is similar to the 'generation' part of the process.

Now. let's say you have some guests coming over and you know their preferences. To accommodate them. you decide to modify your new dish even further or add some garnish to make it look more appealing. This is comparable to the 'augmentation' part. where you make some tweaks to make the final result better suited for its purpose.

Bringing it back to the context of AI and natural language processing. Retrieval-Generated Augmentation is a method where you:

'Retrieve' relevant data or content from a large dataset (like a chef searching through the pantry or recipe books).
'Generate' new data or content based on this retrieved data (like a chef creating a new dish using the fetched ingredients). and then
'Augment' this generated content. usually by making some modifications to better suit the task at hand (like a chef adjusting the dish to suit the guests' taste).
This method is very useful for tasks that involve generating text or other types of data. especially when you want to produce content that is tailored for a specific task. purpose. or audience.

It's also a way to improve the performance of machine learning models. by providing them with a richer. more varied dataset to learn from. The richer and more varied the 'ingredients' (i.e.. the data). the better the 'dish' (i.e.. the model's output) can potentially be.



How we built the damn thing
Part 1: "Retrieve"
For this we would leverage the open-source documents. blogs. systems diagrams and articles by major Cloud Providers such as AWS. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

We created a custom index of just these documents. Using Amazon Kendra. we indexed over 192000 such information webpages using its web-connector. Here. the major difficulty we faced was understanding which XML sitemaps did we have to index and how. Some documents were in Japanese and some were just plain irrelevant marketing content. So intelligent document structure filtering was required at this level to index the right documents for our search.

Thus. this helped us to get the best documents to pull in for a given query. For example the queries below.




Using Kendra for getting top documents for a given search query
Part 2: "Generate"
Alright so you've got the top 10 documents you're supposed to refer to. But how can we improve the experience of gleaning valuable insights for your given business problem? That's where we use the superpower of an LLM. It's like asking it to read all documents and answer over it

So. once we "retrieve" the documents from Amaz√∏n Kendra. we ask the LLM to take the top 5 most relevant documents. pass all the text in them as tokens to the LLM (number of tokens varies depending on the LLM. we used GPT-4 by OpenAI that takes in upto 8000 tokens). The LLM parses the text and via few-shot learning over the context of business problem and the documents from Kendra. "generates" a response for the end user.

This is the simple task. Get the relevant docs and then generate a textual response from the same. Let's improve the experience now.



Part 3: The end-to-end architecture
Stringing together this in an entire experience involved developing the following flow.

Get the input prompt for the business requirement from the user and generate a set of relevant questions about the business to ask the user. For this we used an LLM


We recorded the question answers and the business requirement. did some text summarization and trimming (using nltk to remove whitespaces. punctuations etc.) and then we pass it all as a cumulative context for searching best documents in Amazon Kendra

Next. we get the best docuements from Amazon Kendra as text. combine that with business prompt and QnA and pass it to our LLM for giving a textual response

Once we get the response. we return that. along with hyperlinks to the documents that Kendra returned so the user can get our summarized.structured answer as well as refer the source documents for more information at their own leisure

To help the cloud engineer with more specific information. we added a feature to generate the following from the textual answer
6. Systems diagram for the architecture proposed to understand how to link together the building blocks
7. IaaC code template - Basically a CloudFormation code template to quickly just spin up the architecture and study its performance and behavior in cloud
8. Cost estimation - based on information that the LLM has been trained on. using AWS pricing docs as data source

Lastly. we provided a chat interface for the user to keep passing more requirements (such as "make it cheaper?". "make the system faster?") to the service. Now. we pass a combination of these 4 things to the LLM to get an improved answer = original business prompt + QnA + generated answer + additional user request



What can we improve upon?
Here's the current complete system that was built:



Okay so this project was awesomely exciting but the main complaint I have from it is that it is too slow. It still takes 2 minutes to generate answers and diagrams. A way to improve that would be some compute on frontend or some level of caching

Also. the answers are still generic and unless the prompt is well-engineered. we wouldn't discover novel architectures and solutions. So. that's something we need to fine-tune for. Maybe some sort of a framework for the user to engineer their prompt even better. Asking better technical requirement questions for a given business prompt could be a good starting point.

Lastly. it's expensive. Kendra is expensive and so is using OpenAI. So the approach for solving this is - open-source it! A search index with Elasticsearch combined with a custom LLM such as the Llama. Lima and Flan-T5 models can help cut down on costs

Oooh. a cool feature could have also using voice to speech and language translation (with using localized cloud services docs) to provide multilingual support to our beloved copilot

In closing....
We're having a copilot for pretty much everything these days ever since the Generative AI hype cycle started so I just thought of creating something that could help engineers to better adopt the Cloud Services by any cloud and help leverage them in the best possible way

I'd rather sweat in a garage then recline in a cabin
The story for this starts with wanting to figure out how a student can get from point A in skillset to point B in skillset (their desired ambition) - given an educational ecosystem that provides certain opportunities. And we did realize it. atleast for 3000+ students in my undergraduate college.

I ran Coursepanel for a year and we built several cool things in this journey. I'll keep this blog fairly technical but also throw in certain snippets about entrepreneurship and lessons learnt along the way. Most of this blog is going to be about the technical implementation of this project. I have mentioned my learnings as an entrepreneur in the end.

Technical Deep-dive
Understanding Natural Language Processing and Vector Embeddings
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science. artificial intelligence. and linguistics. It involves programming computers to effectively process large amounts of natural language data. As part of NLP. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. developed by OpenAI. are designed to generate human-like text based on the inputs they receive. They are trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate contextually relevant text.

However. they do not know specific documents or sources they were trained on and don't have the capability to access or retrieve specific documents or databases during the generation process. Their strength lies in understanding and generating text that closely resembles human-like responses. thus forming a key part of systems like CourseGPT.

Vector embeddings are another crucial component of such systems. In the realm of machine learning. embeddings are a way to convert categorical variables into continuous vectors so as to feed them into a model. They can be used to capture the semantics of words in a language. relationships between items. and even user behavior in an application.


Basic demo of how words are converted into vector embeddings (source)

These embeddings. when stored in a vector database. form the basis of effective search and recommendation systems.

Building a vector database using a knowledge graph
For the purpose of this project. based on the previous training data. we turned our knowledge graph (aka ‚Äúskillmap‚Äù) into a vector database for storing entries and answering queries related to academic data. This was done in 4 steps:

Creating a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j: The first step involved modeling our data as a graph and storing it in Neo4j. Our nodes represent entities such as NPTEL courses. books. departments. etc.. and relationships represented the connections between these entities
Generating Vector Embeddings: The next step involved generating vector embeddings from our graph. These embeddings are a form of representation that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of your data in the form of vectors in a high-dimensional space. There are several techniques to generate graph embeddings. like Node2Vec. GraphSAGE. etc. This project used the Node2Vec library in Python to achieve the same. We ran Node2Vec algorithms on our Neo4j graph to generate node and relationship embeddings.
Store Vector Embeddings: The generated embeddings then needed to be stored for future use. Typically. we‚Äôd want a database that is optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. You could use a vector database like Pinecone. Faiss. or even Elasticsearch with a vector plugin for this purpose.
Querying the Vector Database: The final part involved using these vector embeddings to make our application smarter. For example. we could now perform operations like semantic search. recommendations. or similarity checks by comparing vectors. This involved querying our vector database for the nearest vectors to a given input vector. which gave us the most semantically similar entities to our query.
Scoping NPTEL data into the Vector Database and building a chatbot
To create a system like CourseGPT. we first need to load the relevant data into the vector database. Let's assume we have course data from NPTEL in a CSV format. This data can be processed and converted into vector embeddings using various techniques like Word2Vec. GloVe. or even using transformers-based models. These vector representations can then be loaded into the vector database. which allows us to perform efficient similarity search operations.

The vector database enables us to compare the query vector (which can be a representation of a user's query or a specific course interest) with all vectors in our database. and retrieves the most similar entries. These entries represent courses that are most relevant to the user's query.

Once the entries are returned. we need to translate these course vectors back into a human-readable form. This is where LLMs like GPT-3 come into play. These models can generate contextually relevant. human-like text based on the returned entries. The generated text can be as simple as a course name and description. or as complex as a detailed career path recommendation.

In this way. the synergy of NLP. LLMs. and vector databases leads to the development of an effective system like CourseGPT. Such a system can revolutionize the way we approach professional upskilling and corporate training by providing personalized. contextual. and interactive learning experiences.

The journey in a nutshell
The development and evolution of CourseGPT. spread over a 12-month period. could've been a significant step forward in the application of advanced technologies such as AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP). and Knowledge Graphs to the critical area of professional upskilling and corporate training.

The journey began with understanding the problem domain. setting the objectives and scope. and constructing the methodology flowchart. The decision to pick a test sandbox environment of similar nature proved instrumental in aligning the development of CourseGPT closely with the real-world challenges encountered in professional learning and development.

Deep dives into models of corporate training. specifically the Kirkpatrick Model. provided insights into the metrics for successful training outcomes. Skill mapping using a knowledge graph emerged as a novel and efficient approach to resolving course recommendations and facilitating an effective learning journey for the students.

Working with the NPTEL team and building a skill map for IIT Madras underscored the potential of this tool in academic environments as well. Implementing Natural Entity Recognition and NLP allowed us to extract valuable course tags and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Moreover. the research conducted at HyperVerge Academy (HVA) enabled a deeper understanding of the professional upskilling space. Facing and overcoming various challenges along the way. we succeeded in developing a competency engine and data model that significantly enriched the capabilities of CourseGPT.

Finally. CourseGPT emerged as an intelligent product. leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to recommend courses based on career goals. plan academic journeys. solve student doubts. and inclusively cater to diverse learners. The journey. although filled with complexities and challenges. offered valuable insights into the future of AI-enabled learning and set a foundation for ongoing research and development.

Here's the various launch videos of products that I built. just as a nostalgic flash from the past.





Why I failed to run it as a company.
With Coursepanel. we made around 35000 INR in revenue with 3000+ free users and then got stuck in a loop of developing without continuous customer interaction. I shut down Coursepanel in May 2023. I was embarassed. mentally disturbed and self-doubting when I did it. It was hard and it was like I had given up on a dream ¬†and failed myself. But picking up and moving on is the way forward. Here are a few things I learnt from this experience - these aren't novel learnings - these are the same fuckups most startup folks advise against but I did it anyway and learnt it again - at a heavy price:

Don't do it alone. It's not that I'm doubting individual capability - it's just that context switching has a very difficult toll when you ¬†want strong velocity in both business and innovaiton. Also there's the emotional burden of doing it alone. Worst case. atleast have a friend to talk to and help sort out a lot of operations and communications
It's best to build a shitty product with continuous customer interaction but no point of siloed building. no matter what you feel about current systems. Even asking and then building then again asking then building - i.e. an intermittent month-to-month setup might not help. Atleast talk to users each week.
Make money from the start. It's the only way to stay afloat.
Don't get to emotionally attached to your innovation or amazed by exciting new things you can do. Focus on the minimum that gets you paid. get it right and then expand with bolder experiments.
It's boring and requires discipline and routine to continuously outperform other teams. You have to consistently just keep pushing. Motivation is 2/3rds of this game.

So yeah. I guess that's about it. I was very passionate. worked very hard and was heartbroken - but I guess I'm carrying forward a lot - something that classroom would have never taught me. Let's see. I'm about to do something again in the Generative AI space. This time - business first though - get the "what are people gonna pay for" right and then expand from that base thought into technical innovation and exquisite design.

Problems define markets
Having a more accurate understanding of the market in which your product is really competing
A market is not tied to any specific solutions that meet those needs. That is why you see ‚Äúmarket disruptions‚Äù: when a new type of product (solution space) better meets the market needs (problem space)
The ‚Äúwhat‚Äù describes the benefits that the product should give the customer‚Äîwhat the product will accomplish for the user or allow the user to accomplish.
The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the way in which the product delivers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to the customer. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is problem space and ‚Äúhow‚Äù is solution space.
üí°
What = problem space
How = solution space
Lean product teams articulate the hypotheses they have made and solicit customer feedback on early design ideas to test those hypotheses.

Should you listen to customers?
It‚Äôs true that customers aren‚Äôt going to lead you to the Promised Land of a break-through innovative product. but customer feedback is like a flashlight in the night: it keeps you from falling off a cliff as you try to find your way there.

Using the solution space to discover the problem space
Hard for customers to talk about abstract benefits and the relative importance of each‚Äîand when they do. it‚Äôs often fraught with inaccuracies
This can be solved by techniques like "contextual inquiry" or "customer discovery"
The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. If you show them a new product or design. they can tell you what they like and don‚Äôt like. They can compare it to other solutions and identify pros and cons.
The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created
Divergent and convergent thinking
You should be practicing divergent thinking. which means trying to generate as many ideas as possible without any judgment or evalua-tion. There will be plenty of time later for convergent thinking. where you evaluate the ideas and decide which ones you think are the most promising.

you want to capture all the ideas that your team generated. then organize them by the benefit that they deliver.
Then. for each benefit. you want to review and prioritize the list of feature ideas.
You can score each idea on expected customer value to determine a first-pass priority.
The goal is to identify the top three to five features for each benefit.
There is not much value in looking beyond those top features right now because things will change‚Äîa lot‚Äîafter you show your prototype to customers.
A user story is a brief description of the benefit that the particular functionality should provide. including whom the benefit is for (the target customer). and why the customer wants the benefit.

üí°
As a [type of user]. I want to [do something]. so that I can [desired benefit].
¬†eg : As a professional photographer.I want to easily upload pictures from my camera to my website.so that I can quickly show my clients their pictures. ¬†

üí°
INVEST framework
I - independent of other stories
N - not explicit and must be flexible. open for discussion
V - valuable to customer
E - reasonlaby estimate scope
S - small
T - testable
¬†

Small tickets and smaller ticket batch sizes are better
Break tickets into atomic chunks. Trim extra stuff
The batch size is the number of products worked on together at the same time in parallel. Faster velocity of small batches -> faster feedback -> reduce risk and waste
The longer you work on a product with-out getting customer feedback. the more you risk a major disconnect that subsequently requires significant rework.
Scoping with story points
Story points - type of currency for estimating relative ticket size
Have a max threshold for story points
Good operating principle ¬†- break down stories with high points into smaller stories
Return on investment to prioritize
When you are building a product or feature. the investment is usually the time that your development resources spend working on it. which you generally measure in units such as developer-weeks (one developer working for one week).
It‚Äôs true that you could probably calculate an equivalent dollar amount. but people use units like developer-weeks because they are simpler and clearer
Visualizing ROI

Good product teams strive to come up with ideas like idea G in Figure 6.1‚Äîthe ones that create high customer value for low effort.
Great product teams are able to take ideas like that. break them down into chunks. trim off less valuable pieces. and identify creative ways to deliver the customer value with less effort than initially scoped‚Äîindicated in the figure by moving idea G to the left.
The accuracy of the estimates should be proportional to the fidelity of the product definition
The main point of these calculations is less about figuring out actual ROI values and more about how they compare to each other
¬†

Approximating ROI and Deciding on MVP candidate

Just comparing feature importance wrt one another. Once that‚Äôs done. arrange all features in this format as per benefit categories


Intentionally give them generic names so that you can more easily envision replacing them with what would be relevant for your product. ‚ÄúM1A‚Äù means feature chunk A for must-have 1. ‚ÄúP2B‚Äù means feature chunk B for perfor-mance benefit 2. and ‚ÄúD2C‚Äù means feature chunk C for delighter benefit 21.
Decide on the MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONALITY that will resonate with TG users
Look down the leftmost column of feature chunks and determine which ones you think need to be in your MVP candidate. While doing so. you should refer to your product value proposition
After this. focus on the main performance benefit you‚Äôre planning to use to beat the competition
Delighters are part of your differentiation. too. You should include your top delighter in your MVP candidate.
So if you‚Äôve made tentative plans beyond your MVP. you must be prepared to throw them out the window and come up with new plans based on what you learn from customers.

Moving on to MVP and early Prototyping
Use the broad term MVP ‚Äúprototype‚Äù to capture the wide range of items you can test with cus-tomers to gain learning. While the first ‚Äúprototype‚Äù you test could be your live MVP. you can gain faster learning with fewer resources by testing your hypotheses before you build your MVP.

What is/isn't an MVP?

There has been spirited debate over what qualifies as an MVP. Some people argue vehemently that a landing page is a valid MVP. Others say it isn‚Äôt. insisting that an MVP must be a real. working product or at least an interactive prototype.
The way I resolve this dichotomy is to realize that these are all methods to test the hypotheses behind your MVP. By using the term ‚ÄúMVP tests‚Äù instead of MVP. the debate goes away
Product vs Marketing MVP Tests

Marketing test - You‚Äôre simply describing the functionality to prospective customers to see how compelling they find your description
MVP Tests - validate your product will involve showing prospective customers functionality to solicit their feedback on it. You may be showing them a live beta product or just low fidelity wireframes to assess product-market fit
Marketing tests can provide valuable learning. but they‚Äôre not an actual product that creates customer value. At some point. you need to test a prototype of your MVP candidate
Quantitative vs Qualitative MVP Tests

Qualitative - you are talking with customers directly. usually in small numbers that don‚Äôt yield statistical significance eg: If. for example. you conducted one-on-one feedback sessions with 12 prospective customers to solicit their feedback on a mockup of your landing page. then that would be qualitative research

Quantitative - conducting the test at scale with alarge number of customers. ¬†You don‚Äôt care as much about any indi-vidual result and are instead interested in the aggregate results.

eg: If you launched two versions of your landing page and directed thousands of customers to each one to see which one had the higher conversion rate. then that would be a quantitative test.

Quant = what. how; Qual = why

Quantitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many‚Äù: what actions customers took and how many customers took an action (e.g.. clicked on the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button). But quantitative tests will not tell you why they chose to do so or why the other customers chose not to do so. In contrast. qualitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: the reasons behind different customers‚Äô decisions to take an action or not.

If you don't know where you're going. you might not get there
Objective Key-Result (OKR) is a framework of approaching a goal/project that ensures that you and your team make 1000s of decisions and steps. while being aligned on a common vision.

This blog will largely explore the key learnings I've gathered from this awesome book on the topic called "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. If you're curious. this person learnt the OKR framework from top management at Intel and replicated successfully. the same principles - at Google and grew the young startup at breakneck speed with people and products - whilst retaining the core vision of making information easily accessible to all.

The very 1st slide John showed to team Google said OKRS: "A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization"

I'll litter this blog with excerpts and stories that the book explored and I found most helpful.

OKR short intro
Objective is the WHAT is to bo achieved. These are significant. concrete. action oriented and ideally inspirational.

Key Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound. aggressive yet reliastic. Most of all they're measurable and reliable.

Where an objective can be long-lived. rolled over for a year or longer. key results evolve as the work progresses. Once the KRs are completed -> the objective is achieved

Thus. OKRs channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse ops. lending purpose and unity to the entire org. This is supremely important at startups or young companies where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction

The maker of OKR
Andy Grove. an Intel exec is credited for having created the management system of OKRs when Intel had taken up the responsibility of Operation Crush - a race to win in the 16-bit microprocessor market with their 8086 product in a time where cheaper and less performant products were eating market share.

It was the glorious story of how Intel dumped the business of memory-chip and went all-in on microprocessors and completely "crushed" every other contemporary compute company.

Here. are the 1st tenets of this system. by Dr. Grove himself:

Less is more
Set goals from the bottom up
No dictating
Stay flexible
Dare to fail
Here's a free OKR template for your use - link

Great companies take the surplus cash flows created by their sustainable competitive advantages and then either return those to shareholders or reinvest those in their core franchise or - and this is the litmus test of greatness - reinvest those successfully in new activities or markets
"Unusual Billionaires". by Saurabh Mukherjea. is an unusually riveting & practical thesis. It is a collection of stories of brilliant companies that made their dent in the world by continuously innovating. providing great service. and building powerful teams & stable assets. It teaches us the unconventional yet core fundamental process of sustainably building great companies amidst this era of venture-backed rocketship dreams.

In this blog I'll be listing snippets from the book. that teach us all. the values of how great companies our built and share my thoughts on the same. ¬†In this market of the recession of fly-high crashes of crypto exchanges. the gloom of overpowering AI agents & plummeting stock prices. I think we can all take a page out of these learnings & realize how lasting services are created.

Asian paints
Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness. it turns out. is largely a matter of conscious choice. ~ Jim Collins (Good to great)
An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire ~ Yuval Nova Harari
A great company attracts the best talent. commands respect in the business community and. more often than not. trades at a premium in the stock market
Greatness is meant to be an enduring quality. Stock prices are an effect and not a cause of a company‚Äôs greatness
Metrics in a great company
Revenue growth of 10% and ROCE of 15% every year for non-financial services companies
Loan book growth of 15% and ROE of 15% every year for financial services companies
‚ÄúWe have consciously stuck to a sector which is growing and offers decent potential and have always strived for excellence across all functional areas. But it is not because somebody is observing us and is going to applaud us. We have just stuck to our knitting sensibly as the sector has evolved over decades - Jalaj Dani (promoter)
By obsessively using tech and talent to improve on internal processes and efficiencies. these companies put considerable distance between themselves and the competitions. In particular. this focus on efficiency and cost reduction helps the champion companies sustain high levels of profitability in a way that most of their rivals simply can‚Äôt match
Create and nurture an environment in which a multitude of talented minds work in harmony so that mutual competence is reinforcing rather than debilitating
IBAS framework - Innovation. Brands & rep. architecture. strategic assets
Innovation - shopkeeper would get 3.5% extra discount. if. without fail. he made payments on time throughout the year. adoption of computers & GPS
Brands & rep - Asian Paints changed their messaging to maintain an emotional connection with their target audience. Thus came the brand ambassador of a mischievous kid with a can of paint (name - ‚ÄúGattu‚Äù)
Architecture - Creating a truly independent board of directors to help shape evolution of the firm. Rapid career progression for those who perform with job rotation at reg. intervals.
Empowerment allows creativity. It‚Äôs about the feeling of being a family - Jalaj Dani
Strategic assets - sources of competitive advantages - intellectual property. licences. regulatory permissions. access to natural resources and natural monopolies
On the trust Asian paints built - ‚Äú50% of dealers won‚Äôt check their accounts. despite having access to a web portal which gives them real time updates on their accounts‚Äù
Berger
The most difficult thing to change at a company is to change its people

Don‚Äôt recruit someone who is not able to do a job. just to fill a vacancy. Secondly. even if we don‚Äôt have a job. but you come across the right person. you must recruit him

In FY13. talent and skill are increasingly becoming scarce and it requires considerable effort to identify. engage and retain such talents. The report also added that salary alone is not the criteria for satisfaction of deserving employees and that the firm needs to offer a participative work environment and an open culture

Marico
I strongly believe that culture can be a source of competitive advantage in an org and it is impossible to copy. The org‚Äôs culture is a major driving force in the execution of strategy. Correct culture helps in proper execution of strategy by helping everyone align on the same page (Mariwala)
A promoter supporting and listening to the board. although being a 60 percent shareholder. makes indep directors feel proud because we think that we are able to contribute to Marico. These things don‚Äôt reflect directly on the balance sheet. P&L or share price. but these are inputs which go into creation of long-term shareholder wealth
Page
Many companies justify risking balance sheet & profits for fueling growth. However. Page has maintained steadfast financial discipline whilst expanding its operations and at the same time. its share prices have also kept up an upward trend
‚ÄòOur managers understand that it‚Äôs not about having power but about how you empower your subordinates & bring about the best results from your team members. Hence each member behaves like a leader and that gives us a winning culture - Sunder Genomal
‚ÄòFrom day one. Mr Genomal has pushed us into adopting a process-oriented approach. Almost everything we do at Page is part of an Excel sheet.
‚ÄòWe want to keep our distributors‚Äô balance sheets healthy because our business is dependent on their finances. If they have the wrong inventory stuck with them. it neither helps us nor them
Even the core projects will not be taken up unless they promise an ROCE of atleast 20%
Axis bank
Hemant Kaul on Supriya Gupta - My offer letter from Axis Bank had no details about compensation. But the temptation to start a new bank with Gupta overshadowed all my inhibitions - On joining Axis
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in a commodity business. the only way to thrive is to be a low-cost producer. And when you‚Äôre selling money. you‚Äôre in a commodity business - Duff McDonald
Shikha Sharma - I advise other companies‚Äô CEOs not to fall into the trap where you go - Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth - They feel a tremendous pressure to grow. Well. sometimes you can‚Äôt grow. Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to grow. In certain businesses. growth means you either take on bad clients. excess risk or too much leverage - Jamie Dimon (CEO of JPMC)
The shift from people to processes was critical as the bank was moving away from reliance on corporate banking to retail banking (which needs very high use of data & analytics based decision making to grow the business whilst maintaining commercial viability
This operating structure makes the CEO of a pvt bank both less powerful than a promoter of a non-bank company but more influential than the CEO of a non-bank company (pg 209)
Employee policies are very consistent at Axis Bank and there is little ambiguity and subjectivity in the pay hikes and bonuses. All supervisors have to clearly explain the ratings they assign to their subordinates - something that decides pay rise. promotion & bonus. You won‚Äôt find this in other pvt sector banks. where a lot of randomness prevails in salary hikes. bonuses & promotions where lower rated employees have got higher bonuses
HDFC bank
Building a visionary company requires 1% vision & 99% alignment - Jim Collins
An org‚Äôs ability to learn & translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive advantage - Jack Welch
HDFC Bank‚Äôs strength rests not so much on the uniqueness of tech it uses but in the way that tech is lined up in a clever process flow i.e. not envisaged by other banks.
Strong focus on systems & procedures meant that the people who succeeded them did not find it difficult to take over responsibilities quickly
Astral
We came to a point where our day to day business was to just survive. Sandeep Engineer
We had to build scale. We made the market for CPVC in India and if we didn‚Äôt increase capacities aggressively. someone else would have borne the fruit of our hard work. Sandeep Engineer
Instead of copying foreign technologies. Engineer forged technical partnerships with global majors to launch innovative products in India
His biggest strength is simplicity and humility. There has been no change in his personality even after the manifold growth of Astral. He still drinks tea from a roadside stall along with his dealers
Engineer would tell plumbers not to see themselves as plumbers. but as doctors who treat the big problem of leaking pipes in homes
Greatness is not Everyone‚Äôs Cup of Tea
Strategy is about making smart choices and execution is about relentless implementation ~ Phil Rosenzweig
The business of business is a lot of little decisions every day mixed up with a few big decisions ~ Tom Murphy
Those who achieve long-lasting success in India are often those who are unflashy . introverted. determined. and intelligently tenacious
Rahul Dravid‚Äôs of the business world - rare. determined and constantly seeking to improve the edge or the advantage they enjoy vis-a-vis their competitors
What makes a great company:
Theme A - Focus on the long term (more than ten years) without being distracted by short-term gambles
Theme B - Constantly deepen the moat around the core franchise using the IBAS framework
Theme C - Sensibly allocate capital whilst studiously avoiding betting the balance sheet on expensive and unrelated forays
Ability to steadfastly focus on doing the same thing for decades on end whilst gradually strengthening their franchise. generating surplus cash from that endeavour and then giving much of that back to shareholders whilst reinvesting the rest judiciously
Ram Charan - Leaders who say ‚ÄúI have got ten priorities‚Äù don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about
Jim Collins(Great by Choice. 2011) - 20 Mile March requires hitting specified performance markers with great consistency over a long period of time. It requires 2 distinct types of discomfort. delivering high performance in difficult times and holding back in good times
Good management teams work on proving a concept before investing a lot of capital. They are not likely to put a lot of money in all at once. hoping for a big payoff - Michael Shearn
Firstly. diversifications if any. are consciously restrained. instead of breaking or stretching the balance sheet. Secondly. surplus cash. when available. is returned to shareholders when in can‚Äôt be effectively deployed without dragging the ROCE down sharply. Whilst all of this might sound straightforward. these axioms are rarely implemented by Indian promoters who all too often treat their listed companies as their personal fiefdoms and short-change the minority shareholders
A company‚Äôs profitability increases as it moves up the value addition chain
Competitive advantage - if value added is the difference between the cost of a company‚Äôs inputs and that of its output. then competitive advantage allows a company to add more value than its rivals. Furthermore. a sustainable competitive advantage enables a company to continue sustaining this extra value addition over long periods of time
Unless innovation becomes a process which a firm lives day in and day out. the firm will appear impressive initially. and then ultimately disappoint. A product can be quickly outdated. but a successful brand is timeless

What is Back of the envelope?
A Back of the envelope calculation is a simple arithmetic operation frequently carried out on a little piece of paper. like an envelope. Back of the envelope analysis quickly generates a ballpark figure using approximated or rounded figures. An estimate is more accurate than a wild guess but less exact than a formal calculation using precise numbers in a spreadsheet or other program. These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.

In honor of physicist Enrico Fermi. back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.

In this article. we will talk about this methodology's history. applications. and best practices. Furthermore. I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations. Just a disclaimer - the calculations that are about to be added. are made with heavy assumptions - looking at Twitter 2.0 as a new service that we‚Äôll be building & basic components required for the same. The calculations don‚Äôt involve considerations of economies of scale. redundancy. replication and most estimations that involve scaling. We are just understanding a basic implementation of storage for the app. for the scale it is it


Twitter 2.0‚Äôs System Design diagram shared by Elon Musk in November 2022 - Source

Why are back of the envelope calculations needed?
The calculation generally informs us if the design can satisfy the functional requirements. such as the number of supported users. response latency. and resource needs. For instance. when deciding between different architectural designs. the simplest question to ask is whether one server is enough. To get a ballpark figure. we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require. if not one.

Notable Industry Applications
Some of the use cases where back of the envelope calculation has been used:

An important Internet protocol. the Border Gateway Protocol. was sketcBeforein 1989 by engineers on the back of "three ketchup-stained napkins". and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.
UTF-8. the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.
The Bailey bridge is a type of portable. pre-fabricated. truss bridge and was extensively used by British. Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.
The Laffer Curve. which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income. was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.
We've looked at some of the important historical applications of the back of the envelope. now we'll examine the arithmetic process to see how we can utilise it to solve our own issues. This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.

Getting Started with Back of the Envelope
Whenever we try to learn something new. we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly. when beginning system design estimations. we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers. used for estimating the speed of a system. are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency. as a term. helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example. the latency of the best video chat applications. such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.

How can we implement this?
Before approximating the real utilization. we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance. we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.

How can we guess the real usage?

The utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and. if necessary. further divided) and combined.

For instance. we might anticipate 1K active users. each of whom submits 15 requests daily.

15K requests per day. or 15K/86400 requests per second. are involved.

An effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly. Nobody likes to multiply by 86400. To give 0.2 seconds to serve a single request. let's round to 20K/100K. We need to set up at least 4 computers if we know that it takes 0.7 seconds to serve one request. Of course. you don't want to live on the edge. so let's increase the number of machines by a buffer and make it ten.

How to calculate quickly
If someone asked you to calculate: 2456000 x 4598; that would slow things down. wouldn‚Äôt it?

The simpler way to calculate quickly would be instead of spelling down a whole number. use small numbers paired with an abbreviation for magnitude (or. if necessary. exponents). 1K as opposed to 1000.

When given a huge. excessively exact number. such as 7432. immediately translate it to 7K. Anyhow. you are estimating.

This format for numbers makes multiplication and division quick.

KK is M. [K is Kilo; M is Mega]

G/M is K. [G is Giga]

4K7M = 28G.

Round both of them towards a small multiple of a power of 2 or 10 to work with larger numbers.

2714 ~= 3010 = 3000.
6500/250 ~= 6400/256 ~= 100 * 2^6 / 2^8 ~= 100 / 2^2 = 25.
Where to start Back of the envelope?
List the common use-cases of the system and decide which critical resources they require. You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start. but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?

Varied use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance. serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU. whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM. Since you need to purchase machines that are maxed out on both dimensions. hosting all those services on homogeneous machines would waste CPU and RAM.

Such differences indicate those features should be split to different services. hosted on independent sets of machines.

Real-world case study - Storage Costs borne by Twitter

Problem: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements
Please note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers from Twitter.

Assumptions:

300 million monthly active users.
50% of users use Twitter daily.
Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
10% of tweets contain media.
Data is stored for 5 years.
Estimations:

Query per second (QPS) estimate:

Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000
Let‚Äôs start solving
There are 2 important queries that need to be addressed for any system:

‚ÄúRequests per second‚Äù at the server level
‚ÄúQueries per second‚Äù at the database level.
Let‚Äôs start with ‚Äúrequests per second‚Äù & what inputs are required to estimate its number

Users: Twitter has 300 million active MAUs. Not every user on Twitter is an active post-maker. 50% use daily - 150 million DAU
Usage per DAU: 10-25% make a tweet. Again. this doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; getting within an order of magnitude should be fine. Say each DAU. on average. makes 2 tweets: so 0.25%*2 = 0.5 tweets per DAU.
Scaling factor: Usage rate for a service has peaks & valleys throughout the day. Eg: The usage rate for your favorite e-commerce store or food delivery app will heavily increase in the case of discounts or sales in a particular festive season. We need to estimate how high the traffic would peak compared to the average. This would reflect the request per second peak where the design could potentially break. Most people tweet in the morning. so the tweet creation traffic is twice the average when US east coast wakes up.
Thus. total tweets in a day = 150 M DAU * (0.5 tweets/DAU) * (2x scaling factor in the morning)
Thus. requests per second = n/(number of seconds in a day) = n/86400 ~ 1500 tweets per second.
Let‚Äôs now look at how much storage is required for storing multimedia files for tweets.

150 million daily tweets. Say 10% of these tweets contain pictures of average size 300kB each & 1% of tweets contain videos of about 50MB each.
Let‚Äôs assume that the files are replicated with 3 copies each & atleast stored for 5 years.
Storage required for pictures = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.1 of tweets have images)* 300kB (image size) * 3copies = 13.5TB.
Storage required for videos per day = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.01 of tweets have videos) * (50MB video size) * 3copies ~ 225TB.
Total storage required for multimedia files per day = 238.5TB
Just the text for a tweet can be stored within 160B (i.e. 1280 bits ~ 160 characters per tweet on average)
Storage required for tweets per day = 150 M * (160B tweet size) * 3copies = 72GB
Let‚Äôs calculate overall storage cost for Twitter
Thus. we learnt that. for running Twitter. in the most basic sense. the following requirements must be met:

Assuming no data compression & our simple 3x replication. in the most basic form - 238.5TB blob storage required for storing all the multimedia of tweets that arrive in a day. 72 GB storage in database is required just for storing the basic tweet content.
Twitter was founded in 2006. However. it launched image sharing in 2011 & video sharing in 2013.
Thus. we can assume. that average storage required per day for videos uploaded by a growing user base can be our current estimate multiplied by a normalization factor of 0.6 (considering 15% of user growth on average. every year. since year of founding).
Thus. we have about (225TB video storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (9 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 443.5PB videos stored.
Similarly for image storage we have (13.5TB photo storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (11 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 32.52PB images stored
To store total multimedia for 11 years worth tweets. in the most fault tolerant & redundant manner. we need - 443.5+32.52 ~ 476.02PB (this figure is close to the actual ballpark around 500PB that Twitter has officially shared here)
Twitter uses AWS for storage of tweets & accompanying multimedia files. Say we use intelligent tiering by S3 to pay for data. that is most recent & popularly accessed. Other data. we can archive. & fetch on demand & pay for.
Estimating the media storage cost
476.02PB can be broken down into. say - 300 PB till 2019 (considering that video & images got introduced late) and 276PB after 2017.
Assuming the worst case pricing of S3 (the standard pricing) - All the multimedia of the last 3 years‚Äô tweets can be stored in S3 regular access & the other. can be stored in S3 archives (so we save cost) Thus. as per S3 pricing values. we end up paying:

For 300PB in archive: 308.073.20 USD monthly

For 276PB in regular tier: 5.935.645.70 USD monthly

Every year. our estimate of Twitter. pays 6.243.718.90 USD monthly. to store our images & videos.

Estimating the database cost for our tweets
Let‚Äôs use AWS relational database DynamoDB to store tweet data in a structured form - such as user info. tweet text. number of likes & retweets.
Twitter needs to store 72GB of tweets in a regular relational database. each day. to keep the lights on.
Again. estimating our normalization factor of 0.6 to aggregate tweet data. across 16 years since Twitter supporting text sharing right from the start. we get - (72 GB tweet data per day) *(365 days)* (16 years since tweeting was launched) * 0.6 = 252.28TB
Thus. using a standard on-demand DynamoDB (unoptimized for cost. but great for scale) - the storage cost comes to 603.355.92 USD monthly. to store our data.
For an actual analysis of all the databases Twitter uses. checkout this reference link
Here‚Äôs the actual AWS calculator cost estimation performed for this purpose.

Thus. this most basic. unoptimized design of that we made. pays 82.164.897.81 USD = 82 million USD every year to AWS. to keep providing its storage services only.

We have not even begun to discuss the computing costs. the data science costs in the cloud. Also. to keep this article a light read. we haven‚Äôt taken into consideration scalability solutions such as caching. multi-AZ databases and several aspects of storage itself.

Thus. you might now understand why Elon Musk is bent on optimizing this system a lot & even implementing the ‚ÄúDeep Cuts‚Äù plan to reduce infrastructure costs by a billion. But trying to fire 50% of the workforce and have the rest leave because the ship is sinking still doesn't make sense. To top it off. if your major problem is infrastructure cost you don't fire engineers. you task engineers to reduce infrastructure costs. Now. we may not agree or disagree with this logic. but atleast we‚Äôve learnt how to ballpark the financial element of the same.

Cheat Sheet for Back of the Envelope
We studied a way of estimating the storage cost borne by Twitter. But what about getting the speed of a video-game streaming platform? Or the requests per second of a payment gateway?

Fear not. here are a few important numbers that we can use to estimate useful metrics of any software system & what corresponding technical requirements it must be able to satisfy.

What do we understand from this

Memory is fast. but the disk is slow.
Avoid disk seeks if possible.
Simple compression algorithms are fast.
Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible.
Data centers are usually in different regions. and it takes time to send data between them.
In a nutshell
A lot of back of the envelope calculations are done with just coefficients and exponents. e.g.. c‚àó10e. Your goal is to get within an order of magnitude right that‚Äôs just e. c matters a lot less.

What did we learn

Back of the envelope calculations allow you to take a look at different variations.
When designing your system. these are the kind of calculations you should do over and over in your head.
Know the back of the envelope numbers for the building blocks of your system. It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers. you have to know how your subsystems perform. You can't make decent back of the envelope calculations if you don't know what's happening.
Monitor and measure every part of your system so you can make these sorts of projections from real data.
I hope you understood how systems are operated in terms of estimating engineering infrastructure requirements. provisions & costing. What‚Äôs the one system that you want me to target next for back of the envelope analysis?

üí°
Tensor is a number/collection of numbers that maintains its meaning under transformations
üí°
More complex. but correct definition - An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules.
Each index of a tensor ranges over the number of dimensions of space. However. the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta).

Tensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices). vectors (that have exactly one index). and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.
Tensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity. fluid mechanics. and general relativity.
Beginner-friendly
Clearing the meaning. usage and confusions about tensors in ML and math
Tensors. a crucial concept in the field of machine learning. deep learning. and data science. often become a stumbling block for many learners. To fully grasp the idea. we'll break it down. explore examples. and demystify various related aspects such as rank. dimension. components. indices. size. and shape.

What are Tensors?
In simple terms. tensors are a generalization of scalars. vectors. and matrices. They can be seen as multidimensional arrays of numbers. with each dimension known as a rank.

A scalar is a single number. a tensor of rank 0.
A vector is an array of numbers. a tensor of rank 1.
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. a tensor of rank 2.
A 3D array. or a "cube" of numbers. is a tensor of rank 3.
The ranks continue to increase to define higher dimensional spaces.

Breaking Down the Definition of a Tensor
The formal definition of a tensor. "An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules." often overwhelms beginners. So. let's simplify it:

"nth-rank tensor": Rank refers to the number of dimensions or indices the tensor has. For example. a rank 1 tensor is a vector (which has one dimension). a rank 2 tensor is a matrix (which has two dimensions). and so on.
"m-dimensional space": This refers to the size of each dimension. For a matrix (rank 2 tensor). this would be the number of rows and columns.
"m^n components": Components are the individual elements or data points that make up the tensor. For example. in a matrix. each number is a component.
Simplifying with Examples
Consider a 3x3 image with three color channels (Red. Green. Blue). It is represented as a 3D array or a rank 3 tensor. with dimensions of 3 (height) x 3 (width) x 3 (color channels). It would have 3^3 or 27 components (individual color values for pixels).

Delving Deeper: Case of a 4x4 Image
Let's take a more specific example: a 4x4 pixel image with three color channels. Here. the tensor would have a rank of 3 (height. width. and color channels). The dimensions would be 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels). and there would be 4^3 or 64 components.

The indices here refer to the position of each component within the tensor. For example. you might reference the red color value of the pixel in the second row and third column as [2.3.1]. where '2' refers to the row. '3' refers to the column. and '1' refers to the red channel.

The size of this tensor would be calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions together. resulting in 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels) = 48. The shape of this tensor would be (4. 4. 3). describing the number of elements along each dimension.

Difference Between Rank and Dimension
While both terms describe the structure of a tensor. they represent different aspects. The rank is the number of dimensions. while the dimensions refer to the size (or length) of each of those dimensions. In the case of our 4x4 pixel image tensor. the rank is 3. and the dimensions are 4. 4. and 3.

Sample Log of a 4x4x3 Tensor
A 4x4 pixel image with three color channels can be represented as a 3D array (or rank 3 tensor). Each pixel's color is represented by a 3-element vector (for the three color channels). and the image consists of a 4x4 grid of such pixels. giving us a shape of (4. 4. 3).

A 4x4 pixel image with 3 color channels could be represented as a 4x4x3 tensor. like this:


tensor = [
    [  # First row of pixels
        [230. 10. 10].    # Red-ish
        [230. 230. 10].  # Yellow-ish
        [10. 230. 10].   # Green-ish
        [10. 230. 230]   # Cyan-ish
    ].
    [  # Second row of pixels
        [10. 10. 230].   # Blue-ish
        [230. 10. 230].  # Magenta-ish
        [220. 220. 220]. # Light gray
        [120. 120. 120]  # Gray
    ].
    [  # Third row of pixels
        [30. 30. 30].    # Dark gray
        [230. 50. 10].   # Different shade of red
        [230. 230. 60].  # Different shade of yellow
        [10. 60. 230]    # Different shade of blue
    ].
    [  # Fourth row of pixels
        [40. 230. 40].   # Different shade of green
        [50. 10. 230].   # Another shade of blue
        [230. 40. 230].  # Another shade of magenta
        [10. 40. 10]     # Dark green
    ]
]



Clearing the Confusion Around "Dimension"
The term "dimension" can lead to some confusion. In the context of tensors. "dimension" often refers to the depth of nested lists. not the geometric or mathematical space that a vector might represent. So. a vector like [3. 4] is a rank-1 tensor (or one-dimensional array) because it involves no nesting of lists. Its shape is considered to be (2.) because it contains two elements.

In summary. tensors. while initially appearing complex. can be demystified and understood through the step-by-step breakdown of their components and properties. As multidimensional arrays. they provide the foundation for manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning. making them a fundamental concept for anyone delving into these fields.

Exploring more properties of tensors
Understanding Covariance & Contravariance
A vector can be expressed in terms of its contravariant or covariant components

CASE 1: Expressing in terms of contravariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of components with basis vectors

üí°
We need 1 index for each of the components as there is only 1 directional indicator per component. 1 index. 1 basis vector. per component
If we decrease the length of the ‚Äúbasic vectors‚Äù (in a vector space). then the number of components required to make up a vector increases. Because the index & the number of components change contrary to each other. they are known as contravariant components of a vector Describing a vector in terms of these contravariant components (eg : 2 i + 3 j + 4 k) is how we usually describe a vectors


CASE 2: Expressing in terms of covariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of dot-product with basis vectorsIf we decrease the length of the basis vectors. then the dot-product decreases & vice versa. Since these properties are varying in the same way. we say that these are covariant components of a vector.


Specifying the notation for covariant & contravariant components


Now. say we take 2 vectors V & P

üí°
Index (for this rank 2 tensor. i.e. a vector) = unique combination of basis vectors
CASE 1: We multiply the contravariant values of V & P. On considering all possible ways. we get a matrix:

This will give us a tensor of rank 2 with 2 contra-variant index values. Here. each T value is called an element of this tensor. And since for each element. 2 indices (2 directional indicators are required) eg: Understanding by example. say we have a combination of 3 area vectors & 3 force vectors. To get the combination of all the forces on all the area vectors. for each such combination. we require 2 indices (i.e. 2 directional indicators ‚Üí 1 for the force & 1 for the area). We get 9 components. each with 2 indices (referring to 2 basis vectors)

What makes a tensor a tensor. is that. when the basis vectors change. the components of the tensor would change in the same manner as they would in one of these objects ‚Üí thus keeping the overall combination the same

What is it about the combination of components & basis vectors that makes tensors so powerful ‚Üí all observers in all reference frames agree. not on the components or the basis vectors ‚Üí but on their combinations. because they are the same

Index & Rank of tensors
üí°
Rank = the total number of indices = total number of coordinate systems (we need to have knowledge of to understand the location of the tensor) = total number of unique basis vector combinations = total number of unique linearly independent combinations = The total number of contravariant and covariant indices of a tensor.

The rank R of a tensor is independent of the number of dimensions N of the underlying space.
A tensor does not necessarily have to be created from vector components as is shown in these examples

A tensor of rank 1 is a ‚Äúvector‚Äù and has a number associated with each of the basis vectors. Only 1 index i.e. 1 combo of basis vectors is required to know the location


Here. \($V^1 = 5. V^2 = 3. V^3 = 2$\)


A tensor of rank 2 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 2 basis vectors


In a tensor of rank 3 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 3 basis vectors - composed of the components of 3 basis vectors. We can create different descriptions of this tensor by using different contravariant & covariant components of the basis vectors




More mathematical facts
While the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors. the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry. intended to represent physical space) . and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.
Objects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars. those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors. and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation. a vector v would be written $v_i$. where i=1. .... m. and matrix is a tensor of type (1.1). which would be written $a_i^j$ in tensor notation.
Tensors may be operated on by other tensors (such as metric tensors. the permutation tensor. or the Kronecker delta) or by tensor operators (such as the covariant derivative). The manipulation of tensor indices to produce identities or to simplify expressions is known as index gymnastics. which includes index lowering and index raising as special cases. These can be achieved through multiplication by a so-called metric tensor $g_{ij}. g^{ij}. g_i^j$. etc.. e.g..
Tensor notation can provide a very concise way of writing vector and more general identities. For example. in tensor notation. the dot product u¬∑v is simply written u¬∑v = $u_iv^i$ If two tensors A and B have the same rank and the same covariant and contravariant indices. then they can be added in the obvious way.
The generalization of the dot product applied to tensors is called tensor contraction. and consists of setting two unlike indices equal to each other and then summing using the Einstein summation convention. Various types of derivatives can be taken of tensors. the most common being the comma derivative and covariant derivative.
If the components of any tensor of any tensor rank vanish in one particular coordinate system. they vanish in all coordinate systems. A transformation of the variables of a tensor changes the tensor into another whose components are linear homogeneous functions of the components of the original tensor.
Tensors in the context of machine learning
The property of tensors to maintains its meaning under transformations is used also by machine learning. where real world data is transformed into corresponding tensors & then heavy calculations are done on these tensors to get valuable insights.

I used to just get so confused for understanding how do I actually incorporate a culture of powerful customer obsession that big companies like Amazon. Airbnb. Stripe speak so strongly about.

What does it mean? How does that change your workflow? What small optimizations can you do that can ensure you become such a company?

Yeah. you don't need a dedicated team for that - I want to list simple things you can do as a solopreneur in a garage as well.

Here's 4 learnings that I've had. from my current and previous startup. on how to build a reflex muscle for customer obsession. from 120+ overall interviews I've done.

0] an intro to the topic
Customer-centricity means you just know so much about the customer. that when you take decisions about product. you can tell exactly how your customers will react to it.

It's important because it builds very great relationship with them and they will stand by your team and product even when things don't work out that well.

1] 5hrs of talktime per week
If you're having less than 5hrs of talktime with customers. that means you either know everything about them or you need to find a different set of people to talk to. who're willing to spend time to discuss the problem.

Easy ways to get this:

Start by just asking your friends for people in their companies or families for a call and ask them to connect further. If you don't know anyone. just cold reachout your competitors' customers on Linkedin
Just ask for 25min calls. They seem shorter than 30 for some reason so I've seen people say yes and then give you the extra 5.
Ask them to not refer to "anyone". but "1 name" that they can think of - this is fast. and has 100% success rate.
Setup a communication channel on a platform they're most comfortable on. (Whatsapp. Telegram. Discord etc.) where you can just keep talking to them as friends
2] Less than a day of turnaround time
When you're a young company. you can provide near instanteneous customer support and that goes a long way in turning early adopters into evangelists. This is simple - just have them as priority notifications and swear you will reply something the moment you see a popup. Direct lines with founders who ping back quick feel very nice.

3] Organizing their feedback
This is the most important part. I'm sharing my company's template for this. It's just colorful stickies you can move around. but captures certain key snippets across multiple customers really well.

Just pick key sentences they say. tag and color them well - really helps a lot. Here's an example


At our company Recontact. we're helping people be amazing at building long-term relationships in professional and personal settings

Using this strategy. we figured out (check video) that "Maintenance" (i.e. keeping in touch with people) - was the most talked about point in our problem statement - because it had more stickies. And that realization saved us from spending 2 weeks worth of time in making "Search" in our app more efficient - because that's not what our customers cared about.

So yeah. that coloring and legend-making you did as a kid - well that's one of the key components in making a customer-centric business.

4] Building a muscle for the info
Revise. revise. revise. This. I learned from Apple CEO Tim Cook - who starts his day with reading random customer emails. Well. you can always read these stickies. Look into a simple analytics dashboard you can create for your app. - template link

You won't see it instantly. but. over time. a decision-making muscle gets built (very much like driving. music. fashion-sense) - that is very grounded in qualitative and quantitative analysis of customer feedback.

Listen to even the smallest details - you might not remember instantly. but then you'll be surprised how often you'll randomly remember a customer fact. when making a decision related to it.

In closing
You can be crazy passionate about this too - write customer snippets on your wall. listen to customer interviews at the gym. be thoughtful with delighting gifts. send personalized notes when their kids graduate etc. etc. etc.

Bottom line - Be close to the customer. even though the product will not work out. your company will. Business runs on trust and mutual respect.

"Social Capital" is simply the "network of relationships and acquantainces" that a person has developed over life".

We all hear fancy ass quotes about "making strong professional relations". "staying in touch with friends" and "your network is your net-worth". Here's a quick rundown of the best-selling way to build such social capital. since the past 80 years and beyond! Basically. become more likeable.

These are my key pointers from the book "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie. Each topic is its own tweetstorm - so kick back and read these wisdom snippets to help you build a strong people network.

With that let's dive in by understanding 6 ways to be a person who's good at making friends.

6 ways to make people like you
üí°
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
A dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love

You can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can. in 2 years. by trying to get other people interested in you

When you see a group photograph that you're in. whose picture do you look for first ?

It is the individual who is not interested in his/her fellow men/women who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring

You have to be interested in people if you wanna be a successful writer of stories

Can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them

eg : To call someone for an interview. write a letter first enclosing a list of questions that you except them to answer about themselves and their method of work

To find out someone's birthday ‚áí Begin by asking whether he/she believes the date of anyone's birth has anything to do with character or disposition

A show of interest. like every other human emotion. must be sincere

üí°
2. Smile
A smile says - "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you". That is why dogs make such a hit

A real smile. a heartwarming smile. a smile that comes from within. the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace

People who smile. tend to manage. teach and sell more effectively

Smile comes through in your voice

Hard work alone is the magic ¬†key that will unlock the door to our desires. People have succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. As the fun becomes work. people change ‚áí lose joy in it. leading business to grow dull and fail

Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Different mental attitude

Action seems to follow feeling but really. action and feeling go together and by regulating the action. which is under the more direct control of the will. we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not

Thus. the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there

Most folks are about as happy as they make up our minds to be

Picture in your mind. the able. earnest. useful person you desire to be and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual

A man/woman without a smiling face must not open a shop. It costs nothing but creates much

üí°
3. A person's name is to that person. the sweetest and most important sound in any language
The average person is more interested in his or her own name in all the other names on earth put together
Remember that name and call it easily. and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage
The executive who can't remember names can't remember a significant part of his/ her business and is operating on quicksand
Take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds
Most important ways of gaining good will is by remembering names and making people feel important
To recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion
To repeat the name several times during conversation and try to associate it with the person's features. expression and general appearance
Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices
Magic contained in a name should be realized as the single item. wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else.
The name sets the individual apart; it makes him/ her unique among all others
The info we are imparting or the request we are making takes on special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.
From the waitress to the senior executive herself. the name will work magic as we deal with others.
üí°
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention
Dale Carnegie on listening and responding ‚áí Hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise
Good conversationalists are merely good listeners who encourage a person to talk
"Yes. and" - pay attention and show indications of it from time to time with approval or disapproval.
Important personages crave a good listener but ordinary folk do too.
"Many a person call a doctor when all they want is an audience"
If you wanna know how to PREVENT making people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you. here is the recipe :
Always listen to anyone for long
Don't talk incessantly about yourself
If you have an idea while the other person is talking. wait for him/ her to finish
People who talk of themselves think only of themselves
Those people who think of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. no matter how instructed they may be
People you might be talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems
Therefore. if you aspire to be a good conversationalist. be an attentive listener
üí°
5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests
Theodore Roosevelt used to sit up late the night before. reading up on the subject in which he knew the guest is particularly interested in
Road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he/ she treasures most
The reward is an enlargement of life each time you speak to someone
üí°
6. Make the other person feel important ‚Äî and do it sincerely
If we are contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get somethin out of the other person in return ‚Äî we shall meet with the failure that we so richly deserve
Attain the feeling that you have done something for him/ her without his/ her being able to do anything in return for you
The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated ~ William James
Do unto others and you would have others do unto you
Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you". "Would you be so kind as to ‚Äî?". "Won't you please ?". "Would you mind". "Thank you ‚Äî" little courtesies like these. oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday and. incidentally. they are the hallmark of good breeding
The power of honest appreciation is stupendous as everyone considers themselves imp
Every person I meet is my superior in some way ¬†~Emerson
Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
In conclusion
Be interested. smile. remember their name. listen more. talk about their interests and make them feel important. You nail that and you find yourself as a likeable. good friend who is connected to a lot of different kinds of people very well.

This is going to be a super fast guide for developers to leverage platform development tools with VR and build cool apps. Starting with just a laptop and a Meta Quest in your hand.

Here's what the final thing looks like:


Code
Here's the GitHub Repo containing all the code - https://github.com/CMU-SV-Ronith/sem_3pi

Introduction to VR and AI-Generated NPCs
Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we interact with digital environments. offering immersive experiences that blur the lines between the virtual and real world. One of the most exciting advancements in VR is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). especially in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with users in more human-like ways. This blog post delves into the creation of an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. highlighting the technological synergy of VR and AI.

Choosing the Right Engine
When embarking on VR app development. selecting the right engine is crucial. Two prominent engines are Unity and Unreal. After extensive research and testing. Unity emerged as the preferable choice for several reasons:

Ease of Learning and Accessibility: Unity uses C#. known for its simpler syntax and automatic memory management. This choice makes Unity accessible. especially for beginners and indie developers. unlike Unreal Engine's complex C++.
Asset Store and Community Support: Unity boasts an expansive Asset Store. providing numerous resources that speed up development. Coupled with an active community. developers have access to extensive support and shared knowledge.
Versatility in 2D and 3D Development: Unity's proficiency in both 2D and 3D development offers flexibility. allowing developers to work on various project types without switching engines.
Platform Support and Integration: Unity's broad platform support. including PCs. consoles. mobile devices. and VR systems. is vital for developers targeting diverse audiences.
Strong Documentation and Educational Resources: Unity‚Äôs comprehensive documentation and learning resources are invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.
Making API Calls in C# with Code-Walkthrough
We code in C# in Unity. Here's a simple video on integrating Unity App with C# code that you write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgUIx75fJ_E

This was used for the Speech Analysis and Text Analysis functions.

To integrate AI into our VR app. we need to make API calls. This is achieved through UnityEngine.Networking. setting up coroutines for HTTP(s) communications. The process involves getting and posting information. waiting for responses. and updating the UI to reflect changes. We utilize AWS for backend services and the Dolby Media Speech Analytics API for speech analysis.

The AnalyzeText coroutine sends a user's transcript to our backend for processing. while GetAnalysisResults retrieves the analysis. The AnalyseSpeech coroutine sends audio files for speech analysis. and UploadFileToS3 handles the uploading of files to AWS S3.

References of setting up AWS in app - link. video link

API connectors in the app
private IEnumerator AnalyzeText(string transcript)
        {
            var requestJson = new
            {
                prompt = transcript

This article is a refresher to anyone looking to build in sales - the current approach. terminology. key insights. challenges and opportunities available in this domain.


What is a sales funnel?
A sales funnel is the marketing term for the journey potential customers go through on the way to purchase. There are several steps to a sales funnel. usually known as the top. middle. and bottom of the funnel. although these steps may vary depending on a company's sales model.

A basic sales funnel can be described as consisting of 4 levels. Marketers can take inspiration from this basic structure to design a sales funnel that suits the needs of their organisation.

Awareness: At the very top of the sales funnel is the awareness stage that is populated by the largest number of people. These people. not quite ready to be prospects yet. have just had their first interactions with your company and its offerings. They don‚Äôt know much about your brand at this stage. but are aware that it exists.
Interest: The first interactions will hook some of these newly-aware people and draw them slightly deeper into the funnel. With their interest piqued. these people will spend some time getting to know more about your company and your offerings. They might browse your website or catalogue. read your blogs. or peruse reviews from past customers.
Consideration: Armed with knowledge gathered during the interest stage. your prospects will double down on their efforts to know your company and offerings better. They may reach out to your customer service team with specific questions. or fill out a form to access more information. Remember. by this stage they may have already compared your offerings to those of your competitors. So. it is important to clearly answer their questions and help them understand how your offerings can solve their problems or needs.
Negotiation and decision: The prospect has now almost decided to purchase your product or service. Depending on the nature of your offerings. they might begin a negotiation over the price. terms of purchase. or both. But it‚Äôs fair to assume that they have a purchase intention at this stage.
At the end of this stage ‚Äîthe prospect and seller have negotiated the terms of the sale to their mutual satisfaction. and the prospect pays the seller to officially become a buyer.
Extra - Renewal or repurchase: The sale stage is not the end of the sales funnel. Soon a time will come when the sales contract is up for renewal. The customer must now decide if they want to continue with the same seller. If so. there might be a fresh round of negotiations over price and purchase terms. followed by a renewal or repurchase.

Here's an image of the currently most widely used Sales tools and the stage of the funnel they're utilized in:


Why is a sales funnel imp?
That‚Äôs the value of knowing a sales funnel: Successful sellers understand the journey a prospect is likely to take before they buy. and can make sure they‚Äôre ready to move on to each stage. They‚Äôre focused on the buyer. meeting their needs in the moment and building trust that helps move the deal forward.

So what if you ditched the sales funnel? You‚Äôd run the risk of focusing too much on the close to hit quota. pushing products or services when prospects aren‚Äôt ready. Win rates would drop because prospects wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the solutions they‚Äôre offered. and trust would be lost. No long-term relationships. no cross-sells. or upsells.

What challenges does sales have in 2023?
Challenge 1: Standing Out From the Competition
To differentiate from others. salespeople should exceed prospects' expectations by being well-versed in their CRM and sales software. and staying updated with industry trends and news.
Today. SaaS companies offer personalised email marketing. educational content. and in-depth exploratory calls with experienced representatives. Therefore. if you want to stand out from the crowd. you must be one step ahead of the already high standards of helpful. inbound selling.
Gather sales enablement materials like industry specific demos. case studies. reviews. testimonials. and analytics tools or reports.
Keep up with industry news. trends. and reports to help prospects guide strategy and show the potential ROI to their supervisors or other decision makers.
Set up alerts and automation to help you follow up with prospects at the right time and provide valuable resources.
Existing tools - Apollo.io. Outreach.io
Opportunity: This presents an opportunity to innovate in personalized and inbound selling.
Challenge 2: Meeting Quotas
A sales representative's best strategy for achieving quotas and converting leads is to make phone calls - whether they are selling remotely or not.
2. Two thirds of salespeople also use discounts and promotions. and more than half report that they increase sales. The most popular promotion among sellers is bundling a suite of products. followed by free trials.

Challenge 3: Getting in Direct Contact with Decision-Makers
With remote work becoming prevalent. establishing a strong social media presence. particularly on LinkedIn. is crucial for connecting with decision-makers.
In 2023. 67% of sales representatives worked under a hybrid or fully remote basis. and globally. almost 70% of professionals worked remotely. Many leaders and decision makers have physically moved to new locations farther away from their headquarters as industry events have largely shifted to virtual and hybrid formats.
It's crucial that salespeople establish their own presence on social media if they haven't already done so. LinkedIn was rated as the most effective platform for prospect research by nearly three quarters of sales professionals.
Challenge 4: Lack of High-Quality Leads
The first place to look when dealing with lead quality issues is sales and marketing alignment. Having a shared understanding of the ideal customer profile or buyer persona for sales and marketing teams is essential.
Assess the lifetime value of customers and which ones turn into promoters in order to develop and update these assets.
Using tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. HubSpot Sales Hub. LeadIQ. and others. sales teams find and engage with prospects at the right time after identifying target customers.
Challenge 5: Keeping Prospects Engaged Throughout the Sales Process
It is important to understand your buyer in terms of the bigger picture context so you can keep their interest throughout the sales process. which can be lengthy depending on the software package or service you are selling.
It is common for sales representatives to communicate with prospects two to seven times during B2B and B2C sales processes. which adds up when considering that most work with dozens of prospects at once.
The use of automated sales management tools and CRMs with lead intelligence and logging of communications with prospects (such as phone calls. emails. and actions) can help sales teams manage hundreds of data points to successfully acquire new customers.
Challenge 6: Difficulty Getting Meetings With Prospects
Timing is everything. Reach out at the wrong time. you‚Äôre a nuisance. Reach out at the right time. and you‚Äôre the answer to a prayer. It‚Äôs well known in the industry that the best salespeople spend most of their time on calls with prospects listening.
In order to secure meetings with qualified prospects. the best strategy is to listen. And to make it easy to meet with you. When listening for signals that a prospect is ready to meet. use these questions as a guide:
Social selling requires a combination of social media savvy and sales tools that can automatically flag key readiness indicators and send automatic alerts.
Key insights from 30+ interviews with sales and growth teams
Over the past 3 weeks. with conversations over 30 sales people. here are the key insights that stood out from my learnings in the current approach:

Efficiency in Data Management: Many use tools like Excel and Salesforce for data organization. but there's a challenge in maintaining data hygiene and integrating personal notes effectively.
Personalized Customer Engagement: Sales reps emphasize personalized interactions. like remembering personal details about clients and customizing outreach. This includes tactics like social media engagement. client lunches. and gift-giving.
Utilization of Digital Tools: Sales teams heavily rely on digital tools like CRM systems. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. and calendar reminders for tracking client interactions and industry news.
Challenges with Remote and Hybrid Sales: Adapting to remote and hybrid sales environments is a notable challenge. affecting how sales reps connect with decision-makers and clients.
Importance of Relationship Building: There's a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships. seen as crucial in high-value sales.
Adapting to Market and Client Dynamics: Sales reps must adapt to changing client personnel and market conditions.
Efficient Use of Time and Resources: Balancing time spent on tasks like data entry and client engagement is crucial. especially in cold outreach and event networking.
Conclusion
In summary. the sales funnel remains a vital concept in the sales process. guiding potential customers from awareness to purchase.

In 2023. sales teams face challenges like standing out from the competition. meeting quotas. and effectively engaging with decision-makers. particularly in remote and hybrid work environments.

Utilizing digital tools like CRMs and LinkedIn. focusing on personalized customer engagement. and maintaining efficient data management are essential strategies. Building strong relationships and adapting to market dynamics are key to navigating these challenges.

Sales teams must balance innovative selling techniques with the efficient use of time and resources to succeed in the evolving sales landscape.

This blog is from notes from an amazing talk at the OpenAI DevDay conference by Colin Jarvis and John Allard. Here's the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y)
In the realm of natural language processing. optimizing large language models (LLMs) is a formidable challenge. Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity. The performance of LLMs. often abstract and difficult to measure. requires a nuanced approach to optimization. In this blog. we‚Äôll explore a mental model of options for LLM optimization and develop an appreciation for which option to use and when.

You will leave with a foundational understanding of the two axes of optimization‚Äîcontext and LLM behavior‚Äîas well as a practical guide to the nuanced world of model refinement.

The Twin Axes of Optimization

1. Context Optimization
At its core. context optimization is about fine-tuning what the model needs to know. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:

Prompt Engineering: As the lower-left quadrant in our optimization matrix. prompt engineering is your fast lane to setting a baseline. Start by refining the prompts you feed into the LLM and observe the performance changes.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Positioned in the upper-left. RAG introduces more context. Begin with simple retrieval mechanisms. and consider fine-tuning for a more nuanced approach.
2. LLM Behavior Optimization
LLM behavior optimization delves into how the model should act. The two main strategies are:

Fine-tuning: The lower-right quadrant represents fine-tuning. which customizes the LLM‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks.
Comprehensive Approach: Sometimes. a combination of all methods is required to reach the desired performance level. An example would be integrating HyDE retrieval with a fact-checking step.
The key is to start somewhere. evaluate. and then iterate with another method.

Strategies Explored
Prompt Engineering: The Starting Block
Starting with clear. concise instructions and breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks is paramount. Giving models "time to think" and testing changes systematically can yield surprising improvements. Extending this by providing reference text and using external tools can further enhance the results.


When It Shines:

Quick testing and learning
Establishing a baseline for further optimization
Its Limitations:

Introducing new information
Replicating complex styles or methodologies

Retrieval Augmented Generation: Expanding Knowledge
By giving LLMs access to domain-specific content. RAG helps update the model's knowledge and control the content it generates to reduce inaccuracies.


When It Shines:

Introducing new. specific information
Controlling content to reduce errors
Its Limitations:

Broad domain understanding
Learning new languages. formats. or styles
Enhancing RAG:

Employ retrieval with cosine similarity and HyDE
Experiment with FT embeddings and chunking
Implement reranking and classification steps
Evaluating RAG:

On the LLM side. consider the faithfulness and relevance of the answers.
On the content side. assess the precision and recall of the context retrieved. More data does not necessarily equate to higher accuracy.

Fine-tuning: The Custom Tailor
When prompt engineering doesn't cut it. fine-tuning may be the right path. Continuing the training process with domain-specific data can optimize model performance and efficiency. For example. Canva leveraged fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to produce structured output. showcasing the power of high-quality training data.


When It Shines:

Emphasizing existing knowledge
Customizing response structure or tone
Its Limitations:

Injecting new knowledge into the model
Quick iterations on new use-cases
Steps to Fine-tune:

Data preparation
Hyperparameter selection and loss function understanding during training
Evaluation with relevant test sets and expert opinion
Fine-tuning Best Practices:

Start with prompt engineering
Establish a clear baseline
Prioritize quality over quantity in training data

The Combined Approach: Fine-tuning + RAG
Sometimes. a blend of fine-tuning and RAG yields the best results. This method allows the model to understand complex instructions with minimal tokens. creating more space for retrieved context and leading to a more robust performance.




Practical Application
The real-world application of these strategies can be as creative as generating hypothetical answers to enhance similarity searches. For example. initial baselines might yield a 69% performance rate. while a RAG with a well-crafted answer could increase that to 84%. comparable to fine-tuning. Collaborations. such as the one between Scale AI and OpenAI. demonstrate how a combined approach can optimize models to new heights of efficiency and effectiveness.


Careful what you fine-tune on
In conclusion. maximizing LLM performance isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It requires a toolkit of strategies‚Äîfrom prompt engineering to fine-tuning and beyond‚Äîeach with its own set of benefits and best-use scenarios.

there needs to be a part of education that allows students to dream and tinker and take risks. Something that makes them laugh and cry and hope and bond and stay up late in teams and chase self-assigned deadlines and ship something they would have never thought they could.

that was the ideal of buildschool.

we wanted to give students "an ecosystem of believer-builders who built things to solve problems because they wanted to". and having friends around always helps.

but the issue was. we were targeting a student base who had just come back from remote learning. who was not entirely immersed into this tinkering culture and was more driven by definite career paths.

in April 2022. Technical Society (TechSoc) started with minimal funding. full motivation and targeted growth hacks. to grow a strong community. I think the best takebacks from this journey are perseverence. dealing with ambiguity. and faith in the dreamers of tomorrow.

and our approach at TechSoc has always been - invest in the team. invest in the participants and invest in the future. here's 3 stages of how we built a community from scratch and run it well. to this day.

This journey was only possible due to the amazing contribution by Anouksha Hemanth. Prabhat Bedida. Subham Sagar. Yashaswi. Piyush Agrawal. Nikshay Jain. Vishwajeet. GK Harish and several others who made this vision real.¬†
building a team
first. we had to make team buildschool believe that the mission they were solving was important because they would be enablers of a movement much bigger than themselves. so Anouksha and me used YCombinator's startup school curriculum and actually had each manager at buildschool study startup from a perspective of product strategy. history. revenue and future steps. this helped them understand how products are built. gain confidence in talking more about these ideas and also be better thinkers in general. over 2.5 months we did multiple startup teardowns. had these people practice cold emailing founders and speaking comfortably with them. here are some of their early day case studies.

once our little army was ready. it was time to go to war. boy. was it going to be brutal.

inspiring a community
the early days were very random and we had barely any clue of processes and contacts and pretty much anything. we were just very clear on what we had to solve - get 10 student prototypes. not powerpoints. out by the next 13 weeks.

to begin with. the issue was. how do you even get people to care to solve problems? it was always cooler to do fancy PoRs that add sure-shot resume points as opposed to taking a bet on whether you and your buddies could build something or not

and even if people do care. how do you get them to actually learn this process of product building - right from design. to shipping to release to iteration and beyond? well. the answer actually lies in inspiring people.

as Simon Sinek says. if you connect with the "why" of people. you can truly move them to do unbelievable things. and we did all sorts of crazy things to get the message across. here's a video from the early days. just a whiteboard. an ai generated thumbnail and some students talking about a crazy vision of 10 teams. 10 weeks. 10 prototypes.


we did speak to people and touch upon a nerve.

to further this. we revived the history of the "fun in building" through our alumnus Kedar Kulkarni - who started off with very realistic stories of moving up the quality ladder by building computer vision fun-tools with his friends and then moving up to govt partnerships and funded projects. looking back. i think that may have struck a really strong chord - even in me.


something to remind students of where the foundation of innovation lies
sustaining the experience
10 teams selected. basic application on their plan for 10 weeks. we were just looking for grit.

to refine our teams. buildschool organized really amazing talks right from product research and UI designing. all the way up to engineering and growth post launch. we got CXOs and industry veterans to give talks for free - how did we do that? well. we just connected with the "why" of these disruptors through a cold email as simple as:


the thing that sold best was the thought of inspiring students to build more
boom! 7 high quality lectures in various domains - all conducted at zero cost. well. except for the food. it does not have to be complex - ¬†

growth hack - give people free food and they show up the 1st time. give them a memorable experience and they will keep showing up again and again.


give them pizza and they'll do amazing things
and it was hard. students want to do all sorts of things at all times. so we used accountability partners called "build buds" for each team to navigate through getting the right resources. connected to the right folks. and even actually finishing right before deadlines.

guess what - at a mini demo day amongst the teams - 9 of them had a functioning product! here's a random picture from the mini demo day at the 8 week mark.

investing in the future
by the time the 10th week ended. teams had transformed beyond what we had thought. people who didn't know coding had built apps. people who were shy on stage were presenting. people who were unsure about their passions had picked up something new and built something meaningful out of it. well. and the buildschool team - they had gone through the extreme rollercoaster of 0 attendee events (that really happened. it was really stressful) to having a great turnout of 9 products built in those 10 weeks and then we came for a repeat in the upcoming semesters with even more student interest. what makes me smile the most. is that people actually now think of this as a thing they can do full time.


end of buildsprint #1. november 2022
fun fact. one team even got incubated in the startup accelerator at IIT Madras. i look forward to more such stories.

‚≠êÔ∏è here's my takeaway - atleast once in life. i feel. every person must go through the pain and the fulfilment of building something from 0 to 1. because once you're on the other side of the storm - you gain the self-confidence to do anything you want.

that's what our vision at techsoc always has been. cheers and happy building!

Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart is a fantastic tool to deploy machine learning models. In this blog. we'll walk you through the process of using Jumpstart to deploy a model named "Llama2" and expose it as an API endpoint using AWS Lambda functions.

Step 1: Set Up SageMaker Domain and User
Begin by navigating to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Console. Here. create a domain and user profile. This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.

Step 2a: Deploy the Llama2 Model
After setting up your domain and user. head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the "Sagemaker Jumpstart" section. and from there. choose to deploy the "llama 7b model." This process usually takes about seven minutes. and at the end of it. you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this. as it will be essential for the next steps.

Step 2b: Integrating any Huggingface Model with Amazon Sagemaker
Instead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options. you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how

1. Setup development environment
We are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.

import sagemaker
import boto3
sess = sagemaker.Session()
# sagemaker session bucket -> used for uploading data. models and logs
# sagemaker will automatically create this bucket if it not exists
sagemaker_session_bucket=None
if sagemaker_session_bucket is None and sess is not None:
    # set to default bucket if a bucket name is not given
    sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()

    
    
def setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=None):
    """
    Params:
    - default_bucket: Default bucket name to use for the session

    Returns:
    - session: SageMaker session object
    - role_arn: ARN of the IAM execution role
    """
    global sagemaker_execution_role
    session = sagemaker.Session(default_bucket=default_bucket)

    try:
        sagemaker_execution_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
    except ValueError:
        iam = boto3.client('iam')
        sagemaker_execution_role = iam.get_role(RoleName="sagemaker_execution_role")['Role']['Arn']

    return session. sagemaker_execution_role

def mask_account_id(account_id):
    return '*' * len(account_id)

def main():
    sagemaker_session_bucket = None

    session. sagemaker_execution_role = setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=sagemaker_session_bucket)

    # Mask it
    account_id = sagemaker_execution_role.split(':')[4]
    masked_account_id = mask_account_id(account_id)
    masked_role = sagemaker_execution_role.replace(account_id. masked_account_id)

    print(f"SageMaker role ARN: {masked_role}")
    print(f"SageMaker session region: {session.boto_region_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC
Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker. we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend. session. region. and version. You can find the available versions here

from sagemaker.huggingface import get_huggingface_llm_image_uri


## Fetch docker image URI for the Hugging Face DLC:
# 1. backend name
# 2. Hugging face LDC version


# retrieve the llm image uri
llm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri(
  "huggingface".
  version="0.9.3"
)

# print ecr image uri
print(f"llm image uri: {llm_image}")

Hardware Requirements
Llama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B. 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.

Note: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.

MODEL	INSTANCE TYPE	QUANTIZATION	# OF GPUS PER REPLICA
Llama 7B	(ml.)g5.2xlarge	-	1
Llama 13B	(ml.)g5.12xlarge	-	4
Llama 70B	(ml.)g5.48xlarge	bitsandbytes	8
Llama 70B	(ml.)p4d.24xlarge	-	8
Note: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning. e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.

These are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B. 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks. we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances. since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.

It might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.

# confirm requirements met for kernel
import json

def get_instance_type_from_metadata():
    with open('/opt/ml/metadata/resource-metadata.json') as f:
        metadata = json.load(f)
        resource_name = metadata.get('ResourceName'. '')
    return resource_name

def main():
    resource_name = get_instance_type_from_metadata()

    # List valid instance types
    valid_instance_types = ['ml.g5.12xlarge'. 'ml.g5-48xlarge']

    if any(instance_type in resource_name for instance_type in valid_instance_types):
        print("Instance configured correctly")
    else:
        print("Need to upgrade to at least 'ml.g5.12xlarge' instance")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
4. Deploy Llama2 to Amazon Sagemaker
To deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id. instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type. which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.

Note: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.

import json
import getpass
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel


def get_sagemaker_config():
    # sagemaker config
    instance_type = "ml.p4d.24xlarge"
    number_of_gpu = 8
    health_check_timeout = 300

    # Define Model and Endpoint configuration parameter
    config = {
      'HF_MODEL_ID': "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf". # model_id from hf.co/models
      'SM_NUM_GPUS': json.dumps(number_of_gpu). # Number of GPU used per replica
      'MAX_INPUT_LENGTH': json.dumps(2048).  # Max length of input text
      'MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(4096).  # Max length of the generation (including input text)
      'MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(8192).  # Limits the number of tokens that can be processed in parallel during the generation
      'HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN': getpass.getpass("Enter your Hugging Face hub token")
      # .'HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE': "bitsandbytes". # comment in to quantize
    }
    return instance_type. health_check_timeout. config

def create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. image_uri):
    # check if token is set
    assert config['HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN'] != "". "Please set your Hugging Face Hub token"

    # create HuggingFaceModel with the image uri
    llm_model = HuggingFaceModel(
      role=role.
      image_uri=llm_image.
      env=config
    )
    return llm_model


def main():
    instance_type. health_check_timeout. config = get_sagemaker_config()
    
    # Set role and image_uri
    role = sagemaker_execution_role
    llm_image_to_ref = llm_image
    
    # Declare llm model with create_hugging_face_model module
    llm_model = create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. llm_image_to_ref)
    
    # Deploy model to the endpoint if llm_model is available
    if llm_model:
            llm = llm_model.deploy(
                initial_instance_count = 1.
                instance_type=instance_type.
                container_startup_health_check_timeout=health_check_timeout
            )
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
5. Run inference and chat with the model
5. Run inference and chat with the model
After our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:

temperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.
max_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20. max value is 512.
repetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. defaults to null.
seed: The seed to use for random generation. default is null.
stop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.
top_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null. which disables top-k-filtering.
top_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling. default to null.
do_sample: Whether or not to use sampling ; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.
best_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs. default to null.
details: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.
return_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.
truncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.
typical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.
watermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.
You can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation

The meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:

[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>

{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]

We create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt. which converts a List of "messages" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.

def build_llama2_prompt(messages):
    startPrompt = "<s>[INST] "
    endPrompt = " [/INST]"
    conversation = []
    for index. message in enumerate(messages):
        if message["role"] == "system" and index == 0:
            conversation.append(f"<<SYS>>\n{message['content']}\n<</SYS>>\n\n")
        elif message["role"] == "user":
            conversation.append(message["content"].strip())
        else:
            conversation.append(f" [/INST] {message['content'].strip()} </s><s>[INST] ")

    return startPrompt + "".join(conversation) + endPrompt
  
messages = [
  { "role": "system"."content": "You are a friendly and knowledgeable vacation planning assistant named Clara. Your goal is to have natural conversations with users to help them plan their perfect vacation. "}
]
# define question and add to messages
instruction = "What are some cool ideas to do in the summer?"
messages.append({"role": "user". "content": instruction})
prompt = build_llama2_prompt(messages)

chat = llm.predict({"inputs":prompt})

print(chat[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Now we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.

# hyperparameters for llm
payload = {
  "inputs":  prompt.
  "parameters": {
    "do_sample": True.
    "top_p": 0.6.
    "temperature": 0.9.
    "top_k": 50.
    "max_new_tokens": 512.
    "repetition_penalty": 1.03.
    "stop": ["</s>"]
  }
}


# send request to endpoint
response = llm.predict(payload)

print(response[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Step 3: Integrate with AWS Lambda
With your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand. navigate to AWS Lambda. Here. create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:

import json
import boto3

ENDPOINT_NAME="jumpstart-dft-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b"
runtime= boto3.client('runtime.sagemaker')

def lambda_handler(event. context):
    data = event["body"]
    print(data)
    
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME.
        ContentType='application/json'.
        Body=data.
        CustomAttributes="accept_eula=true"
    )
    
    response_content = response['Body'].read().decode()
    result = json.loads(response_content)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200.
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }
Step 4: Grant Necessary Permissions
For your Lambda function to work correctly. it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions. create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17".
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0".
      "Effect": "Allow".
      "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint".
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Step 5: Expose Lambda Function as an API
Once your function is ready and permissions are in place. expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.

Step 6: Testing Your Deployment
To test the setup. use a curl command. like the one below:

curl --location 'https://khhg37edhrmibhj4ahsxqnqlha0qoqqc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "inputs":"I believe the meaning of life is".
    "parameters":{
        "max_new_tokens":256.
        "top_p":0.9.
        "temperature":0.6
    }
}'
This command sends a POST request to your Lambda function. which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.

In Conclusion
Setting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process. It offers scalability and ease of integration. making it suitable for a range of applications. For more detailed steps and best practices. you can refer to this official AWS blog.

Executive Summary
Virtual Reality (VR) is poised to revolutionize education by offering immersive learning experiences. Mel Slater's 2016 research emphasizes VR's potential for implicit learning. making abstract concepts tangible and enhancing understanding. Platforms like Bodyswaps. combined with Oculus VR headsets. promise innovative soft skill training. The booming VR market. projected to reach $165.91 billion by 2030. testifies to its growing influence. Comprehensive research objectives have been outlined. focusing on long-term effectiveness. personalization. inclusivity. cost implications. and device efficacy. The research aims to ensure VR's effectiveness and relevance in the rapidly evolving professional world.

Problem Selection
1.1 Statement
Virtual Reality (VR) offers a transformative approach to education. expanding the boundaries of traditional learning. Mel Slater's 2016 paper. "Implicit Learning through Embodiment in Immersive Virtual Reality." elucidates this potential by delving into the concept of implicit learning. where individuals acquire knowledge without conscious awareness (Slater. 2016). VR's immersive nature is largely attributed to two illusions: Place Illusion (PI) and Plausibility Illusion (Psi). PI gives users the sensation of being in a virtual environment. leveraging the body's natural perception methods. while Psi makes events in VR feel authentic (Slater. 2016). The sense of embodiment. where one's physical body is substituted by a virtual counterpart. enhances this immersion.

1.2 Understanding the Potential
The educational potential of VR is highlighted by its ability to transform abstract concepts into tangible experiences. Instead of mere observation. students can actively participate. visualizing and manipulating realities that would be otherwise challenging or impossible in the physical world. Such hands-on experiences advance explanations and deepen understanding (Slater. 2016). The incorporation of VR in education also shifts the pedagogical paradigm. placing students at the focal point of instructional attention.

Another study examining the efficacy of VR in K-12 and higher education found VR-based instruction significantly impacts various learning outcomes (Effectiveness of virtual reality-based instruction). Factors like learning outcome measures. type of learning tasks. and feedback mechanisms moderate the effectiveness of VR instruction. suggesting a tailored approach to VR integration can yield optimal results.

The expanding VR market. projected to grow from $25.11 billion in 2023 to $165.91 billion by 2030. underscores its burgeoning influence (TAM). Specifically. the VR education segment is expected to reach a valuation of $46.14B by 2027 (SAM). Such growth is indicative of VR's increasing integration in diverse sectors. including education.

Moreover. the unique data potential of VR. as seen in a 2023 study where motion data allowed researchers to identify users with over 94% accuracy. promises personalized learning experiences. enhancing user engagement and facilitating predictive analytics. Such data-driven insights can quantify skill development. bolstering stakeholder confidence and paving the way for novel monetization strategies.

1.2 On Bodyswaps and Meta
Bodyswaps. a cutting-edge VR training platform. specializes in honing soft skills through immersive simulations. enabling learners to practice. receive feedback. and even view their interactions from another's perspective. This innovative approach to learning facilitates deep introspection and skill enhancement. When integrated with Meta's Reality Labs' Oculus VR headsets. users can experience Bodyswaps' transformative training in a seamlessly immersive environment. The synergy between Bodyswaps and Oculus could redefine soft skill training. making it more accessible. effective. and in tune with the digital age's demands. This partnership promises a future where learning transcends traditional boundaries. merging technology with human-centric education.

1.2 Reflection
Virtual Reality (VR) is revolutionizing the educational landscape by transcending traditional learning boundaries. Slater's 2016 research highlighted the immersive potential of VR. emphasizing implicit learning and embodiment. The integration of VR into education promotes experiential learning. making abstract concepts tangible. The booming VR market. expected to reach $165.91 billion by 2030. emphasizes its growing significance. Moreover. platforms like Bodyswaps. when combined with Oculus VR headsets. promise innovative soft skill training. blending technological advancements with human-centric educational approaches. The future of learning seems to be at the cusp of a VR-driven transformation.

Futurecasting. - or the art of envisioning the unforeseen. is a crucial skill in our dynamic world where the tide of events can shift unpredictably. Our perception plays a pivotal role in determining how we steer our ship into the future.

Mental Maps and Perceptions
As individuals. we need to acknowledge that our understanding of the future is inevitably tinted by personal perceptions and biases. not objective truths. Each person's mental map. the internal framework we use to navigate decisions. varies. and these maps significantly influence the decisions made regarding the future.

The Risk of Success
Ironically. success might be one of our biggest stumbling blocks. Past triumphs can make us overly reliant on the mental maps that brought us to our current position. A strategy that yielded success in the past isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work indefinitely. and overconfidence in these tried-and-tested mental maps might blind us to other possibilities and opportunities.

The Pitfall of Incorrect Maps
As the legend goes. the first set of Spanish voyagers actually thought that there was a water body connecting south-west and north-west coast of USA. And they made a wrong map. with full confidence. not knowing their mistake. Fun fact. until 16 years. voyagers used the wrong map and after multiple complaints. they were finally able to break the mental model of the government to actually update the map. And that process took 160 years total. The story of the erroneous map of the USA. used for 160 years due to stubborn belief in its accuracy. serves as a telling example. An incorrect understanding leads to misguided actions. and once a particular map (or belief) is accepted. altering it becomes a formidable challenge.

Asking Uncomfortable Questions
Futurecasting is not about comfort; it's about preparedness and openness to disquieting truths. It requires us to challenge our convictions and ask questions that make us squirm. This process involves thinking divergently about what lies ahead. questioning the mental maps we hold dear. and being willing to redraw them as needed.

Navigating with Awareness
Much like skilled sailors navigating the waters with an acute awareness of tides and winds. individuals and organizations need to craft strategies with a deep understanding of global currents and shifts. Where you eventually land is a result of both your goals and the global factors that either facilitate or hinder your journey.

Case in Point: The Oil Business

A look at the oil industry. where success is traditionally measured by rig count. reveals a critical mistake. Businesses often take one scenario. tweak it slightly. and convince themselves that they are working with different models. However. slight variations of a single view do not capture the diversity and unpredictability of the real world.

Learning from IBM

A picture from forecasting by an IBM leader. saying that PCs weren't a good enough market
IBM‚Äôs monumental miscalculation of the PC market potential‚Äîestimated at a few hundred thousand dollars. while the real value was a staggering $30 million‚Äîcost them dearly. The mental maps of their strategists. albeit successful in the past. failed to envision a scenario where PCs would be ubiquitous. missing out on a colossal opportunity and leaving an estimated $200 billion on the table - $100 billion for the software OS (Windows. then called MS-DOS) and $100 billion for the chip making market (that Intel captured)

Scenario Thinking: An Essential Tool
To prevent these decision traps. scenario thinking is invaluable. It helps to mitigate overconfidence. encourages outside-in thinking. enables seeing the full picture. corrects problem framing. and promotes asking the right questions. The goal is not to predict the future accurately but to ask better. more insightful questions. to prepare for a variety of possible futures.


Conclusion
Futurecasting. therefore. is a dance between confidence and humility. knowledge and curiosity. planning and flexibility. It's about continually asking "what if" and being prepared to redraw your mental maps to navigate the thrilling. unpredictable. and often unthinkable tides of the future. Let's escape the confines of our minds and be open to the vast. exciting possibilities the future holds.

Checkout this comprehensive analysis of various stakeholders. factors and strategic outcomes - link

If the very essence of employability is threatened then isn‚Äôt it important to talk about it?
And this time it is different. We talk about how technology shifts have been there. but this time its different. Today there are 78 million jobs that are vulnerable to be automated (IMF Report. 2021). And not enough non-routine. cognitive jobs being created (62mill) to fill this unemployment. gap(IMF Report. 2021). And lets take today‚Äôs discussion to talk about how this unfair wealth battlefield can be given its justice. It is currently important to study how this divide is ‚Äúcreated strongly due to technology‚Äôs impact on employability‚Äù.at this point time - and prepare ourselves for an ambiguous future

1. Job Displacement due to Automation
Automation has pierced through not just manufacturing sectors. but a vast array of industries. radically transforming the employment landscape. Far from being limited to routine and repetitive tasks. modern technological tools are expanding into spaces we once believed were uniquely human: content generation. graphic design. music composition. and even video editing.

Data Snapshot: Forecasts warn that a staggering 800 million workers worldwide could find their roles obsolete by 2030 due to automation. Furthermore. an alarming statistic states that 60% of all occupations have at least 30% of tasks that can be automated. signifying the breadth of the potential impact.
2. The Daunting Skills Gap
The velocity at which technology is advancing presents a conundrum. On one end. there's a surge in tech-centric roles. while on the other. there's a glaring skills deficit. This gap is even more pronounced among certain demographics: the elderly. individuals in rural settings. those encumbered by responsibilities. people with disabilities. immigrants. refugees. and professionals in non-tech domains.

Data Snapshot: The World Bank's 2020 report on the digital economy illuminated the magnitude of this disparity. noting that a mere 1% of Africa's workforce possesses ICT skills. Moreover. Deloitte's findings underline this crisis. with 64% of employees believing their organizations are unprepared to bridge this skills chasm. Adding fuel to the fire. only 17% of institutions are confident about having a future-ready workforce.
3. Escalating Income Inequality
The technological boom has inadvertently created a rift between high-skilled tech aficionados and low-skilled workers. As the former group reaps the benefits of a tech-driven economy. the latter. especially those susceptible to automation. grapples with stagnating or diminishing wages.

Data Snapshot: As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. the wage gap between those armed with a college degree and those with just a high school education has been expanding. The United Nations' ITU highlights another facet. pointing out that a lack of access to digital tools and the internet exacerbates income inequality.
4. Concentration of Wealth: The Tech Elites
It's undeniable that the tech era has given birth to a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals. This isn't just about riches but also the power and influence that come with such immense wealth. from influencing political decisions to shaping economic policies.

Data Snapshot: 2021 data reveals that the collective wealth of global billionaires skyrocketed to over $10 trillion. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. the ten wealthiest individuals added a colossal $450 billion to their coffers. To put this disparity into perspective. the top 1% of the global populace controls more than 44% of the world's wealth.
5. Gig Economy: Freedom or Feudalism?
The gig economy. bolstered by technology. promises flexibility and autonomy. Yet. it's essential to ponder whether it's a genuine avenue for empowerment or merely a modern form of feudalism. where workers. despite being 'connected'. remain isolated and vulnerable.

Data Snapshot: The gig ecosystem has witnessed explosive growth. with 36% of the U.S. workforce engaged in gig roles. cumulatively contributing to a market valued at $204 billion.
In synthesizing these insights. the digital age emerges as a paradox. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. it simultaneously casts shadows of inequality and uncertainty. As we navigate this era. it's paramount that stakeholders ‚Äì from governments to corporations to educators ‚Äì work in tandem to ensure that the digital future is inclusive. equitable. and just.

I did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software. This blog would be the story and the specifics of what a lot of people have asked me over the years. about how I made the switch and some things that you can use too. if you're interested in the same

I'll keep a major part of this blog very generic to the topic "switching streams" in general and then I'll add a section. at the end. about things I did.

Continuous learning is the name of the game
Today. learning anything is completely possible. at any given point. if you're willing to put in the work.

A lot of times we're under the notion that only a few people can learn a skillset based on the course they're "officially" enrolled in or some background experience they've had. I don't believe so. I think. that in this all-knowing YouTube and ever-improving-chatGPT era - anyone can learn anything from the Internet - for free. at their pace and convenience and from tonnes of world leading tutors.

Here are some pointers that might help you:

There is no magical playbook - to learn anything. it takes a lot of time and persistent effort of finding the right material for yourself and creating a roadmap for improving in the skill. So it's fine if you're not having a clear path to start with. There are a couple of channels that can give a clear path. but I think. that just starting from a Google or YouTube search about the topic name is a good place to start.
Taking notes really helps - Even if it's rough screenshots. scribbling random thoughts while learning or just copy-paste's of youtube videos - it works. I'm currently exploring YouTube video summarizer plugin in ChatGPT for this purpose. What's even better is revising and refining notes - for smarter reference later. It's like creating a power pellet from your learnings that you can consume at any point in the future to catch up on the skill super-fast. I used Notion for organizing whatever I've learnt into easily reference-able notes.
Motivation is 2/3rds of the game - Dedicate a fixed time slot for learning and keep struggling to make the most of it. Have very little ego. Initially you might suck - that's cool. But after breaking your head for about 1-2months. you'll not even realize but you'll naturally start seeing patterns and connections. That's the next level.
You shouldn't be afraid to suck at something new and give up if you struggle across even when understanding a paragraph of a new topic. Hell. when I was learning programming. it took me about 12hours to fully grasp and implement a 5 min youtube video about animation. But then. relentlessly pursuing on and on and on. I was able to condense 12 hr worth learnings into 5mins of revision through my notes. It's going to be hard. but if you just stick with it. it's going to be worth it.

The world is project-driven
We live in a fast paced world where most teams just look for how much value an individual can add to their team. If you've independently taught yourself and built impactful projects. no one really cares about your background coming from.

This can be harvested well to your benefit if you want to even your odds with those. who are already in the stream you like. Just build projects that rival with them. And these days YouTube has walkthroughs of any project across any stream for free - it's just so good.

Here are some key pointers to help you in this leg:

Projects are strong applications of learning - Project can mean anything - a tiny robot. a sketch. a basic app. a research paper commentary. a spreadsheet. ¬†a 5sec musical composition. a youtube video - anything. Point is - you're supposed ¬†to have employed your learnings and you're supposed to have worked super hard. It will help grasp the reason of each thing you thought was dumb but you read anyways and help translate it into moving parts of something very impactful
Start by copying other people's work - A good place to start is searching for existing projects on the internet and interpreting and recreating their work. Painters. musicians. writers. chefs - do it all the time while practicing - just patiently learning from the experience of others. This would help avoid pitfalls and learn best practices from your teachers. Again - don't just blind copy as they do. Refer - understand - try to recreate - fail - go back to refer- then understand - then try to recreate and so on.
Add your own flavor to each project - Employ a personalized touch to your project so that its unique. In the early days. I liked reading so when I came to programming projects - I would just add quotes of my favourite personalities in them as my touch. Now for you. it can be anything you like. but once you do this. you just differentiate extremely well from every other person who's just blind-copying and give a polished overall outcome
Tie the project to your ego - I get why this might be a double-edged sword but hear me out. Once you set a benchmark for the finished expectations from a project - tie it to the fact that it's something the world will see as a finished project from "you" and hence it can't fall below a certain quality threshold. For me. it used to motivate me to always push the project to completion and have it satisfy some baseline criteria.
Learn and grow with stakeholders - Some projects. you might not do alone and hence the coolest thing would be to learn from your collaborators and ensure they have a good experience working with you. Believe it or not. people and team skills are still one of the most important virtues for any team. Have fixed meetings. track your progress. hit your metrics and note down and share - what each of you learnt from the project. Projects offer collaborative opportunities and hence you can learn much beyond the books and the internet - you learn from people and in a lot of ways - what you learn will surprise you.
The more you passionately employ your learnings into real-time applications the more strongly your education will stick to you. ¬†

How to sell yourself
The next step after building projects is to share your work with the world and capitalize on it.

Few pointers on this are:

Have an online gallery - Every time you learn something. it would really help if you could maintain a online browsable gallery of your work. Be it your GitHub page or Dribbble gallery or LinkedIn profile or blog page. Just everytime you wrap up learning something. create an online snapshot for the world to view your thinking. approach. knowledge depth etc.
Look for interesting people and DM them: I used LinkedIn. Each time I found a person with interesting work - I would DM (Direct Message) them on LinkedIn and if possible. even get on a call to understand how they thought and learn from them. Seriously. it helps so much to get other people's feedback on your approach. Beyond this. there are obviously interesting conferences that you can just boldly sign up for. attend and be the newbie who talks and learns from everyone.
Confidence is free: In the early days in this new stream. you'll often feel imposter syndrome and underconfident - so start pretending otherwise. With time. it will grow into something more solid and with the knowledge and experience piling on. it would just compound. Confidence also helps express passion and clarity for the subject matter so the more you are confident about your projects and subject matter. the more people would value your work
I guess that about sums it up - in a nutshell - randomly search for ways to learn. iteratively keep sucking till you get better. build toy projects that make you happy and confidently talk about them on platforms. Rest. I'm 100% sure. the journey you take will help you figure out.

My story
Alright. now I'll be more specific about my story and things I did. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. thinking that a good college. a good job would be the only salvation. So naturally. once I got into the 4 year Civil Engineering program at IIT Madras. I thought that this would limit me from pursuing anything lateral. But in this internet-learning driven age. that's hardly the case.

To find what I liked - for a year. I dated a lot of career options - photo and videography. standup comedy. automotive engineering. consulting. designing. architecture and many countless others - mainly through hanging with different clubs of students in my college. ¬†Once I stumbled upon "software startups" I've just felt an irresistable pull to it. that stands to this day. Obviously there are a lot of days where I've doubted it too. but if it's your calling. some part of you always knows and gets attracted to it.

Now the specifics okay. I'll make it pointwise and list specific instructors and courses so that you can maybe check them out:

Disclaimer: You don't have to do it like me. Just read my opinion and do it the way most apt to you :)
I learnt the basics of programming in C Language from the hard copy book - How to C. by Prashant Kanetkar. It took me 4 months with my other college work helps understand the foundation of how a piece of code is designed. written. interpreted and executed.
Next 4 months. I learnt web development (HTML. CSS. JS) from DevEd. WebDevSimplified and Brad Traversy. I also use Laith Harb for time to time learning of new skills. Also. I used to build a lot of toy projects that these youtubers would post walkthrough videos of - this udemy course of 20 projects with Javascript is pretty sweet - link. Also learnt Git during this time
I used to also pursue first 2 hrs of any random long 7-8hr videos from FreeCodeCamp's youtube channel - anything from Data Structures and Algorithms to CyberSecurity to even color designing. I even did a bit of digital illustrations from from Gary Simon.
After this. I was consuming content and courses very fast. In the next 2months I learnt NodeJS. ¬†React and TypeScript. GraphQL. Docker and other misc topics. These are the most common industry technologies in use these days.
I even learnt basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and some Systems Designing from Algoexpert. A good place to start learning the basics of literally anything programming or computer related is Fireship - who does amazing 100second video intros of a tech.
From time to time. I've flirted with Machine Learning and AI courses from DeepLearning. ZeroToMastery and random blogs and projects and stuff. But these 2 sources are very strong for it
Next up. I was having trouble deploying apps and understanding large scale software so I studied systems designing from Gaurav Sen since it helps fall in love with the strength of computing. I also completed certifications from AWS. Google and Microsoft with the help of Stephane Mareek's amazing content
In fact. I feel that Stephane Mareek's course on Cloud Computing is a must-do for any software engineer to appreciate the beauty of internet and all cloud services that become the strong backbone of it. Just do this course. trust me.
Yeah and after that I got into generalist mindset and I was brushing up on everything from Figma for designing to Flutter for app development and was tinkering with over 10 frameworks and DevOps products at any given point for building great software.
To start getting more professional experience. I used to always offer myself up as a cheap developer to startups. I remember cold reaching out to 200+ engineers and founders (not HR since they have less of a say in hiring than actual engineers who lead teams) on linkedin over 4 months before I landed my 1st internship.
In startups. ¬†I could learn a lot everything about businesses - in the high-growth-vacuum environment that startups offer. Plus I made some money. re-invested that back in random tech-courses and business-books that I used to pick like a kid at a candy store and kept building and building a 2nd brain of mine in Notion.
I kept up my spirit and did create projects entirely from scratch on my own right after the 1st 6months even though they felt shitty and didn't work as well. Some. I couldn't even afford to keep running cause I would have to enter credit card details and I didn't have one back then. So I created YouTube videos or blog posts and shared the code as I sunsetted each project deployment. You can find a log here - link. Point is just keep trying honestly.

2nd brain in Notion
Yeah and after that I tried to run my own software startup. made some money and I failed to run it long term (here's the story of it - link).

I balanced all this work with college. Fun thing is. once you do projects. everyone wants to give you a shot - be it professors looking for programmers or startups looking for part-time developers.

A lot of times. people ask me how I managed my time or remembered so much. I do not. I just used "Google Calendar" and practiced using a lot of tools to keep reminding me to meet my goals and do my things. Every night before I go to sleep. I plan my next day's calendar for 10mins to be a good student. programmer. student-club head. brother. son. friend or any role that I feel is important dedicating my time to. Recently I even started to take Mondays to plan 3 to 4 most important things I wanted to achieve in each sphere of life in that week - like learning to cook. or reading a book. finishing an online course. deploying a project. teaching my mom about tech or even learning to play squash or salsa dancing with my friend - I tracked it all so I knew if I was missing out on time for any of my commitments.

My academics did take a hit no doubt - but I knew that I wasn't giving enough time to it and why I wasn't so it was cool.
Recently. I ended up applying to Carnegie Mellon University.

It took me a lot of research and advice - and I made this document to put down my thoughts. goals and opportunities - link. This was the single most important thing I did before choosing what I wanted to do next. I showed this doc to my seniors. people I knew and respected. family and friends and finally collated their advice into a decision.

For applying. here's all I did:

I gave the GRE test (325/340 with 4.5 in essay writing) and TOEFL test (111/120) though I didn't think GRE would have much weightage now. People say you gotta take paid courses and prep for 5 months and I don't believe it. Just mark your calendar. Go through this free material I aggregated in 2022. for GRE and TOEFL and you'll be able to get it done sooner.
Next. I talked a lot about my projects in my SoP. I wrote about majorly. creating impact through startups and software. you can give it a read - link.
My CGPA in academia was 8.01 out of 10 in my undergraduate college. I willingly didn't study as much in class or in pen-paper exams. But I pursued projects passionately and that's where I caught up on.
For Letters of Recommendation - 1. I got from the CEO/Founder 1st startup I worked with for 9months. Next. a letter from a Computer Science professor in my undergraduate whom I helped for free as a DevOps engineer on his logistics project. back in my 3rd year. I got my 3rd reco letter from my favourite Computer Science professor who had taught me 1 course (and that too I didn't score that well XD). but he just looked at my profile and work and decided to give me a shot. And yeah. that's where sometimes just asking gets you to. I just wrote him (and other profs too) an email and he called me for a 20min meeting and decided to help me out
I guess with all of that. I'm now headed for a Masters in Software Management to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I've messed up a lot. Have done a tonne of random things and kept exploring. Some of it worked. Most didn't.


In the end. I just have 1 advice - read a lot of opinions to expand your world view but at the end. internalize all that info with with what feels right in your heart. and trust me. just fuck it and do it.

Here's just a basic email thread exchange I had with 1975 passed-out alumni of Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) - exchanging talks about the way things are at IITM right now in 2023 vs in 1970. What ensued were views about IIT Madras and India in the 1970s. This is a fun anecdotal blog that tells 2 stories from different ages and how. from studying what happens in India's colleges. we can study the broader outlook of technological progress in the nation

1970s
Following is the message from an alum - Sudhir Krishna who passed out in the 1970s

B.Tech was a 5-year program. ¬† Half of the first year was spent toiling in the workshops wearing khaki uniform. ¬† The curriculum was course-heavy: ¬†Usually had 7 courses per semester. and reached 8 courses in the 7th semester (4th year). ¬† Continuous contact hours from 8 AM to 4:15 PM (with lunch from noon to 1:15 PM). ¬† ¬†Not much free time for creative projects except in the final (10th) semester. ¬† ¬†The German collaboration was still evident and some German faculty were still around. ¬† The campus population (students. faculty. administrators. staff) was much smaller than it is now. ¬† ¬†We all had single rooms in hostels. ¬† The annual cultural festival Mardi Gras was started and has now become Saarang (right?). ¬† ¬†Students were multi-talented -- academics. music. chess. bridge. quiz. drama/ acting. mimicry. sports. literary activities. etc. ¬† I myself was captain of the institute chess team. member of the institute tennis team for a couple of years. won the institute debate contest one year. represented IIT-M at the cultural festivals of other IITs. and became Under Officer in NCC Air Wing.
Also. back in the 1970s. India was still a poor country with a socialist economy. ¬† The country's global image was associated with poverty. backwardness. ¬† Only some American universities and companies were aware of the IIT brand. most notably Harvard Business School (where I got my MBA) and management consulting firms like McKinsey. ¬† Even back then. HBS admissions officers said they viewed IIT B.Techs the same way they did MIT and Caltech undergrads. ¬† But they made fun of Indian typewriters that were used for completing the application forms

I received an invitation from McKinsey for an interview that began with "Because of your Indian Institute of Technology background......."

2023
I recently graduated from IIT Madras. The hostel sector is quite lush with trees starting to form canopies above. The monkeys are not only more in number now. but more in daring as well. They're smart. bold and know how to work the system to get what they want.

The academics are strong and flexible with students having the option to pursue whatever they want. irrespective of their BTech department. A lot of application and project based courses have sprung up where we do assignments and mini-projects as opposed to just written exams.

Students are a lot in number now and it's fun to see everyone put honest hard work in their passions - right from technology and sciences to art. music. comedy and gaming. You find people of all interests and talents. The labs and workshop are still hands-on. though only about 40% of what it used to be in the 1970s. The departments have also developing into independent schools of specialization on their own with tonnes of activities. projects. lectures. events. yearly festival and more. In fact. the new department called "Engineering Design" - (near Velachery Gate) offers a lot of product designing and entrepreneurship encouragement in both- ¬†hardware and software. There's the department for management studies. humanities and flexibility of leveraging online platforms like NPTEL (https://nptel.ac.in) apart from attending in-person classes.

Here's my favourite part - the student-run project lab - Center for Innovation at IIT Madras - has over 20 teams and a 2 storey cool building. each one tinkering in topics all the way from AI. robotics. app development and racecar engg to energy efficiency. rocketry. product designing and rural tech (check this for more - https://blog.techsoc.iitm.ac.in/tech-iitm-in-5-mins/). So I'd say recovering from the pandemic. projects are at a powerful high

Hostel culture also seems to be re-igniting. guess a lot of it got hit during the pandemic years but teams like Schroeter. LitSoc and TechSoc are putting the fire back in. Athletics is strong and we won 1st in Men's championship and 4th overall in Inter IIT Sports Meet. We bagged 6 medals in Inter IIT Tech Meet (Golds in AI and entrepreneurship) and came 3rd in Inter IIT Cultural Meet.

In a nutshell. IITM has become the perfect home for pursuing anything passionately
Speaking of animals - monkeys are ruling the hostels so much so that we get a complaint email about monkey assault every week or 2. They're bold and smart and compete for food. ¬†The deer and blackbuck population is also fair and we do hangout with them in lawns sometimes. Dogs were actually moved out of the campus in 2019 since they used to hunt deer. There's a species of red ants we see all the time and snakes are barely spotted once or twice a year during rains. if anytime. Funnily. scorpions are seen near admin buildings and hostels sometimes
Workshops are lighter and we have much more time for creative activities. If you can think of it. there's a club for it working passionately.
On nearby places - Right now. Taramani is still go to for tea. snacks and cigarettes and food delivery orders. There are 2 cycle repair shops in insti. We get great breeze. most likely attributed to the greenery since the construction has blocked out the sea breeze. Student's these days hang out mostly around a huge mall outside Velachery. the food shops along the 100 ft. Road outside Taramani. Elliot's and Marina beach. Chetpet Eco-park this place called "Hidden Lake". Tada waterfalls in Andhra. and Westin bar (if you have money :)). But insti itself is I think the most happening place for so many technical. sport and cultural things that folks barely step out.
On innovation- Self-innovation and Entrepreneurship is being spearheaded by the new Director - Professor Kamakoti. In collaboration with Indian government. Professor Prabhu Rajagopal and his team - is doing several things to help students build products and eventually. companies. In fact. a couple of companies like Ather. HyperVerge. Solinas Integrity - born right inside IIT Madras - are making waves. Most recently Clueso got funded by YCombinator in 2023 and it furthered more students to do this.
On inside insti ¬†- The Dhaba outside Saras is now a full-fledged restaurant with all kinds of Indian food. juices and snacks. It's currently managed by the caterer - Zaitoon - but the tender is open for bids every 3 years. We had to recently monkey proof it due to the stealing incidents XD. The first floor of this is converted into a colorful place with a large television screen for student clubs to sit and ideate. Mummy Daddy Andhra mess outside Taramani is our go-to place for Biryani. Our tuition fees. without scholarship. are now INR 1.00.000 and hostel fees is INR 26.000 for each semester. The hostel bonding. as Srikanth said. is more shifted to clubs and messes are detached from hostels. This has helped in knowing a lot more breadth-wise bonding.
A lot of construction is going on now. There are 2 new Academic complexes. And a new sports complex is being made near the tennis courts
IIT Madras is a lot more creative. entrepreneurial. ¬† Its population is much larger. ¬† The post-graduate programs have grown a lot. ¬† Admissions quotas based on caste and gender have made the student population more diverse. ¬†(We had very few women during our time.) ¬† The IIT brand name is now world renowned. but still based largely on its undergrad B.Tech program and not yet for post-graduate and research programs. ¬† IIT alumni have distinguished themselves in America and reached the highest levels in industry and academia.

Also. India as a country has changed. ¬† It is capitalistic. entrepreneurial and technologically advanced. ¬† The country's nominal GDP is world #5 and projected to become world #3 by 2028. ¬† PM Modi. in my opinion. is a superstar on the global stage and gets royal treatment wherever he goes. ¬† Geopolitically. India is viewed as a counterweight to China. ¬† This is shaping up to be a China-India century and will be very evident by 2050. ¬† As for IITs. there are 23 of them now. ¬† While the 5 original IITs still rank at the top in India. some of the newer IITs are establishing niches of excellence for themselves. ¬†IIT Madras is ranked at the top.

Attaching a couple videos and pictures of campus here for your reference
Checkout these videos:

Campus tour - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUfsG5xQnuU








Fruit juices are still cheap. Canteens still open till 3am. Sunlight still glitters through trees. Students still mess around but have that drive to innovate and lastly - friendships are still stupid and meaningful.

I recently graduated from Indian Institute of Technology. Madras. Here's 8 lessons I learnt from my 8 semesters and stories of how I learnt them so this is not some lame vanity post.


July 2019. entering college
Semester 1: It's a big world and trying everything. even lying outside your comfort zone is free. Be open to talk to everyone and make tonnes of friends. Semester 8 will teach you why its important. I picked up this lesson while borrowing 300 from a hostel guard to pay for pizza at 3am. attempting failed jokes at open mics and also while countlessly sitting in club orientations. It's always a good time to suck at new things :)


Semester 2: It's college. you can sign up for tonnes of things and asking anyone for help is free - people genuinely want to help. I learnt this while being disciplined and trained by the legends of the Raftar Formula Racing team as we championed 3 national trophies against all odds. Discipline and accountability take passion and convert it into wonders.


Semester 3: Just build projects that teach you skills you find cool. Persistence and hard work will help you trump all odds to be good at what you love. Maintaining motivation is 2/3rds of the game. Sitting in a COVID ridden world. using my neighbour (Jay Bafna's) WiFi to learn software development and making dumb projects like todo apps taught me that just inching a little closer to ambition. Preferably start an online presence of you that tracks your work well - write about your work and share


Semester 4: At this point. I'd say start taking bets on yourself and bold risks is the best - you're young - what's the worst that could happen? I learnt this core lesson when I decided to leave home and work at Farmako (YC S20) with a different set of legends. Having very little resources and pure hunger to survive and succeed over 9 months taught me a lot about the brilliant impact a small determined set of people can have on the world. Be stupid. take more bets. You're young and smart - you'll figure it out


Semester 5: You'll see a world of people who seem to have figured it out and gotten it right. But most of us are just winging it. I'd say at this point. just being real with a couple friends and still believing and taking bets is the hard path. I personally learnt it through shit tonne of mistakes. self-doubt and pain and tears that 2 things in life mattered - I was working on something I cared about. and I was around people I loved. I follow this principle to date. Not caring about a lot of external stimuli is a superpower you can acquire by just self-assessing.


Semester 6: You're growing now. Tension is building up and you're probably expected to have figured out life. You don't. In fact it's a good thing if you've failed over 3-4 times by now - it means you're trying and getting back-up enough. Having a vague idea of how you want to spend time - that's something I'd recommend having. A good idea here is take up something. and no matter how much it pains. see it through completion. Working with Logistics Lab. IIT Madras and Coursepanel taught me that enduring and reaching the finish line is way more important than procastinating for perfection or giving up midway. That's a major differentiating factor too.


Semester 7: You're probably multi-tasking at this point. Become boring. routine-driven - use a calendar and documentation tools to string multiple tracks together. Write a lot - it helps unclutter the mind and think clearly. I know it's boring but having control over how your time. energy and money flows by writing stuff down goes a long way. It helps aim long for a year and piece it down to what you and your team need to do today. I learnt this while helping Institute Technical Society (TechSoc). IIT Madras frame its vision from to 1700+ participants. 14 events and countless projects. I learnt that small tasks with directed effort moves mountains.


Semester 8: It's your turn to give back now. Now your old friendships will blossom and it's time to be ready for new ones. Be there as a mentor your junior self would have appreciated. Preferably take up a position of responsibility that's undervalued and difficult and lead a team through and through. no matter what it costs. I think the Inter IIT Technical Meet at Indian Institute of Technology. Kanpur where we went from stranded on a railway station to nailing medals in Kanpur (2000 miles away) in under 40 hours.


Most lessons are not my own and have been taught to me by amazing amazing mentors. friends. family members and I'm undeniably grateful to.

This blog won't solve your problems - hell. mine also took a fuckload of meanderings before I got to understand them. Think of it as more like - not repeating my fuckups. College is a mix of confusion and opportunities. wins and losses - in a short time frame so screw everything and feel free to ping me anytime if you're going through something and need a ear. Listen to all this - but the best part is - don't do it like me. do it like you. üòâ

Machine Learning projects may seem complicated at first glance. but in reality. they follow a systematic flow that. once understood. makes the whole process quite straightforward. In this blog. we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.

Let's first sing a song to kickoff this blog


In a nutshell. what are we gonna talk about
It's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section. I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead. I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!


Steps of ML
0. Become One with the Data
The initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data. identifying potential outliers. and understanding the relationship between different variables.

1. Preprocessing Your Data
Raw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning. normalization. and standardization of values.

When dealing with large datasets. it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as "batches". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor. and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.

2. Creating a Model
Starting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A "baseline" is a relatively simple. existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress. you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.

3. Compiling and Fitting the Model
Once you have decided on your model. the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function. optimizer. and the evaluation metrics. After compiling. fit your model to the training data. allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.

4. Evaluating the Model
After your model has been fitted. it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
In order to improve the model's performance. you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.

Remember. overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting. consider using techniques such as data augmentation. regularization layers. or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.

6. Iterate Until Satisfied
The above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.

8. Explore Advanced Techniques for Improvement
Once you have beaten your baseline. you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model. training for a longer period. finding an ideal learning rate. using more data. or using transfer learning.

Deep Diving into templates and tricks
Processing the Data
The first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it. thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data. where actions such as rotating. flipping. and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.

Shuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset. such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training. consider shuffling your data.

When processing your data. you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:

StandardScaler can give each feature zero-mean and unit standard deviation.
MinMaxScaler provides a non-distorting. light-touch transformation.
RobustScaler is useful for reducing the influence of outliers.
Normalizer provides row-based normalization. using l1 or l2 normalization.
Refer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.

Start with a Baseline
Starting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:

Creating a model: Define the input. output. and hidden layers of a deep learning model.
Compiling a model: Define the loss function. optimizer. and evaluation metrics for the model.
Fitting a model: Train the model to find patterns between features and labels.
Baseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. based on your project's requirements.

PyTorch
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Set the number of epochs (how many times the model will pass over the training data)
epochs = 100

# Create empty loss lists to track values
train_loss_values = []
test_loss_values = []
epoch_count = []

# Put data on the available device
# Without this. error will happen (not all model/data on device)
X_train = X_train.to(device)
X_test = X_test.to(device)
y_train = y_train.to(device)
y_test = y_test.to(device)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    ### Training

    # Put model in training mode (this is the default state of a model)
    model_0.train()

    # 1. Forward pass on train data using the forward() method inside 
    y_pred = model_0(X_train)
    # print(y_pred)

    # 2. Calculate the loss (how different are our models predictions to the ground truth)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred. y_train)

    # 3. Zero grad of the optimizer
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # 4. Loss backwards
    loss.backward()

    # 5. Progress the optimizer
    optimizer.step()

    ### Testing

    # Put the model in evaluation mode
    model_0.eval()

    with torch.inference_mode():
      # 1. Forward pass on test data
      test_pred = model_0(X_test)

      # 2. Caculate loss on test data
      test_loss = loss_fn(test_pred. y_test.type(torch.float)) # predictions come in torch.float datatype. so comparisons need to be done with tensors of the same type

      # Print out what's happening
      if epoch % 10 == 0:
            epoch_count.append(epoch)
            train_loss_values.append(loss.detach().numpy())
            test_loss_values.append(test_loss.detach().numpy())
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch} | MAE Train Loss: {loss} | MAE Test Loss: {test_loss} ")
Tensorflow
# Now our data is normalized. let's build a model to find pattern

# Set a random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# 1. Create a model
model_2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28.28)).
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10. activation="softmax").
])

# 2. Compile the model
model_2.compile(
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy().
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam().
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# 3. Train the model
norm_history = model_2.fit(
    train_data_norm.
    train_labels.
    epochs = 10.
    validation_data = (
        test_data_norm.
        test_labels
    )
)
Plotting training and testing loss
## Plotting training and test loss

# Plot the loss curves
plt.plot(epoch_count. train_loss_values. label="Train loss")
plt.plot(epoch_count. test_loss_values. label="Test loss")
plt.title("Training and test loss curves")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.legend();
Evaluating Our Model
Visualizing our model's predictions and its performance metrics is an integral part of model evaluation. Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems. evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.

Tracking Experiments
Visualizing our model's predictions
Apart from that. a good way to proceed is visualize. visualize. visualize!

It's a good idea to visualize

The data - What data are we working with? What does the data look like?
The model itself - what does our model look like
The training of a model - How does a model perform as it is learning?
The predictions of the model -How do the predictions match up against the ground truth (the original labels)
To visualize our model's predictions. it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values

def plot_predictions(train_data=X_train. 
                     train_labels=y_train. 
                     test_data=X_test. 
                     test_labels=y_test. 
                     predictions=None):
  """
  Plots training data. test data and compares predictions.
  """
  plt.figure(figsize=(10. 7))

  # Plot training data in blue
  plt.scatter(train_data. train_labels. c="b". s=4. label="Training data")
  
  # Plot test data in green
  plt.scatter(test_data. test_labels. c="g". s=4. label="Testing data")

  if predictions is not None:
    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)
    plt.scatter(test_data. predictions. c="r". s=4. label="Predictions")

  # Show the legend
  plt.legend(prop={"size": 14});
To efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations. it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.

Improving Our Model
Build the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....

Improving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation. compilation. and training stages.

During the model creation stage. you might add more layers. increase the number of hidden units in each layer. or change the activation function. In the compilation stage. changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.

This process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as "hyperparameter tuning".

Approaches to improve accuracy

Get more data -> Get a larger dataset that we can train our model on
Hyperparameter tuning -> Use more hidden layers or increase number of neurons in each hidden layer
Train for longer -> Give your model more of a chance to find patterns in the dataset
Save a Model
Saving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment. like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow. depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch. the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().

PyTorch code
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Create models directory 
MODEL_PATH = Path("models")
MODEL_PATH.mkdir(parents=True. exist_ok=True)

# 2. Create model save path 
MODEL_NAME = "01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth"
MODEL_SAVE_PATH = MODEL_PATH / MODEL_NAME

# 3. Save the model state dict 
print(f"Saving model to: {MODEL_SAVE_PATH}")
torch.save(obj=model_0.state_dict(). # only saving the state_dict() only saves the models learned parameters
           f=MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
Run on GPU
Running your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function. where device is set to "cuda" for GPU or "cpu" for the Central Processing Unit.

Conclusion
In conclusion. understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively. Remember. machine learning is an iterative process. and it's okay to go back and forth between steps to improve your model's performance.

Introduction
As we progress in the age of digital transformation. organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework. an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda. is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management. which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless. and how does it function? In this blog. we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.

What is AWS Serverless Framework and How is it Helpful?
The Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes. either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda. you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.

Installing Node.js and Python on Your MacOS Machine
Before we start with the Serverless framework. we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.

To install Node.js. we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:

brew install node

For Python. MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However. it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:

brew install python

To verify successful installation. type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.

Setting Up AWS and Serverless CLI on MacOS Machine
After installing Node.js and Python. it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:

npm i -g serverless

Upon installation. verify the version using serverless -v command.

To deploy your functions on AWS. you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command. replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin

How to Invoke. Deploy. and See Logs of Serverless Lambda Functions
To create a new service or function. use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example. to create a Python service:

sls create --template aws-python --path myService

To deploy this function to AWS. use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only. use sls deploy function -f functionName.

To test a function on AWS. use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.

What is AWS SAM and How to Set it Up on MacOS
AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions. APIs. databases. and event source mappings.

To install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS. first. install the AWS CLI:

brew install awscli

Next. install AWS SAM:

brew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli

Initialize a new SAM application using sam init. choose your desired runtime (e.g.. Python). and template. To build your application. navigate to the project directory and use sam build.

You can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API. you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.

To deploy your application. use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke "FunctionName".

If you need to delete your stack for any reason. you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.

You can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode. click on "Add Debug Configuration" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.

For Python packages management. you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.

Conclusion and Why Serverless is Useful for Cost-Saving
As you can see. the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating. deploying. and managing serverless applications. Moreover. by leveraging these tools. we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.

Serverless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage. it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions. which leads to significant cost savings. especially for applications with variable workloads.

We hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.

TechSoc IIT Madras was one of the most stressful and fulfilling decisions I made in my last year in institute. We upscaled the tech culture at the institute through organizing 20+ competitions. 15+ guest lectures - resulting in 22
products. events impacting 2000+ students. I‚Äôd personally recommend this to any person who shares these 2 traits -

passion of driving a solid tech culture at our university
willingness to test their limits to stand for something bigger than themselves
I‚Äôll talk mainly about 6 things about my tenure as TechSoc Head from 2022 to 2023. where we captured the engagement of over 2000+ students. having conducted 15+ guest lectures and 20+ technical events.

The Initiatives
The Experience
The Growth
The De-merits
A crazy story
Cool stuff I got to do
FYI - Although this blog is all motivational stuff. we failed a tonne of times. but we did end up making people smile and make amazing things - and that's what it's all about.

The initiatives
My approach was and always has been - invest in the team. then invest in the customer and then invest in the future. The fun part about this 3 step process is the more you invest in the earlier phases. you're actually also investing well enough in the latter parts.

Investing in the team
The most important part was always that each member on the team felt proud and challenged and happy about the work we did. They had to grow. they had to be happy and challenge their own problem solving skills - else it wasn't worth it.

So here are a couple things I tried and liked:


not the full team. some suckers missed picture day
A training period
Spent atleast a month for new joinees to get used to "entrepreneurial activities" - like studying companies. making presentations and pitching. drafting detailed reports. running collaborative projects. cold emailing. corporate relations. This helped the team learn a lot in a short period of time and gain confidence.

Here's a syllabus if it helps - link

But yeah. if you want top-quality. hard-working. smart people actually working with you on your vision - gotta train your army to fight. You can start by defining the vision of your team. and what culture you want to carry into this.

Meeting structuring
College is a complex time with lotta priorities. commitments and spontaneous plans. It is important to have a definite meeting structure so that you stay consistent and add a punctuality aspect to respect everyone's time.

If anyone came late. they bought ice-cream to everyone who came before.
If the meeting didn't end on time. then I would buy ice-cream for everyone in the meeting
Every meeting had a document and actionables that people could take back so we always met with a direction. discussed agenda as per time and walked away with usable data and direction.
This structure is something I learned from Sharavanakumar at Khatabook and to this day. I'm grateful for it.

OKRs
OKRs - helping break down the overall vision into just 3 things each of the 18 of us had to get right each week - while working with each other. We were 18 disruptors - 54 things per week. pointing in 1 direction - helped us grow like crazy.

Team Happiness and Culture
At TechSoc. you always get a birthday cake. If you're in person - team folks even show up for your celebration at 12AM. We ensured that in our weekly retros. we had shoutouts for everyone who did great work in that week. Every event we saved on. the surplus would go back to team treats and gifting goodies. We were transparent about our money and trusted each other with it. Apart from that. we'd enjoy late night sessions on the lawns playing games (Mafia. Truth and Dare. "Albatross") or singing or sharing stories about ourselves.

Investing in the experience

give them pizza. they will build amazing things
Every event at TechSoc was a collaboration with another technical team on campus. And they're usually busy with projects but do want the publicity on campus. Every meeting we had with them. went as follows:

Why are we doing this event? What do we want to takeback from it
What does the event do? What's the best date and why?
How will the overall flow of conducting look like?
How do we market it?
What do we need (human resources and props) to run it successfully?
What are some loopholes we should consider when organizing this?
Metrics tracking and SWOT analysis
All this information would then be captured in a document - sample. This document would contain all the plan. the necessary links and people collaborating on it.

On ground. here are some values we ensured each time we conducted the event

Participant is god. If it means you're cycling with one hand and doing repeated samosa deliveries. sticking posters everywhere or ensuring that they have water - you gotta do it.
TechSoc never gives up. No matter how much things screw-up. And they did. like. all the time. Once there was an internet issue in a seminar we were streaming while a billion dollar CEO waited on the other end. But we recouped and did the damn thing
After-event work happens super fast. Everything from prizes. to score updation. to social media. website updating and everything.
Investing in the big picture

Mandakini hostel team. who made a car that did obstacle detection realtime
"Always build on top of your previous work". A lot of what we did at TechSoc compounded in on itself over time. We started with arguing and justfying INR 7000 rupee budgets for paper plane events and in 1 year got to INR 1.5 lakh AI hackathons. The way to do this was:

Update the fricking website - ensure that the overall presence of TechSoc was always up to date with everything that we had achieved so other people could review. With time. as we did more things. we became more awesome and it kept compounding with time. This helped get external attention and investment as well.
Build extensive documentation - Every document. going in. with time. created such a strong clarity and database - everything from important contacts to event documents and plans and costs and the whole thing - just mind-blowing. It helped a lot of people collaborate and introspect and evolve work with time.
Align everyone. Repeatedly - Every meeting. or party. or failure point - it was super important to just tell everyone what we stand for.
The Experience
Technical Society is a relatively growing student body and so the job is obviously hard. The place my team had to start from was how to even get 5 people to show up for an offline event when we were reeling back from the pandemic. Key points of my experience are:


the aero contingent team from our university (L to R - Akshat. Ayush. Pranit. Reddy Anna. my Alak boi. Sukriti)
It‚Äôs a fricking rollercoaster - There are events that go super well and then there are others where 0 people show up. My highs were really high and lows were equally painful. I‚Äôve wanted to quit and dump so many times but then there were equally balanced nights of euphoria and adrenaline
It‚Äôs about the team- Investing in the team‚Äôs growth during the summer following my recruitment was one of the best decisions I made. Because this strong loyal team stood while we encountered multiple hits over failed early events in the first semester. And now I see the same shy-to-even-turn-on-their-video-camera students stay up 14 straight hours. jugaading food and leading the conduction of tech events on campus.
Diplomacy is everything - I‚Äôve had to be nice in multiple f-you conversations and taken a lot of sit from multiple participants and stakeholders at a lot of points. Being rational more than emotional. knowing the right words to pitch to the right decision maker for an approval. collaborating with other student bodies for mutual vision alignment - that kind of thing
The tech community has heart - Tech-community is introverted. reserved and fit the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù description (barring a few outliers). But these are the same people who will pour their heart out for finessing a project - right from scribbling on whiteboards to presenting products. stand by and help each other for free. bond over late night tea conversations and pizzas. fight when they‚Äôre sleep deprived and drive real impact to push the society forward. This inspirational set of people is worth fighting for
The Growth
Gigantic network - This is the most golden essence of being in an technology college. I reached out far and wide:

interacted and connected with the most passionate tech enthusiasts across all domains at my university
connected to nationwide college's top talent through a joint Tech board
became part of a top class university entrepreneur community
multiple companies (GitHub. Unacademy) that sponsored our events
Being a better planner - Every TechSoc event had to be granularly figured out - right from the why. to the domain. to the logistics (approvals. finances. food). marketing plans. grading patterns. feedback loop and process documentation. And prior to that - figuring out which initiatives to run for which target audience and how that tied into the TechSoc vision to provide something to students that they were missing out on.

TechSoc taught me about this more than anything. You have to be a better planner than you ever were when you‚Äôre handling over 5 Lakhs of budget and getting around 30-40 things right in stressful weeks.

Becoming a stronger person - A leader is looked up to be a responsible and strong person. But no one is born that way. You learn by getting hit with a brick in the face. I learnt to be resilient. have more patience. lose the fear of crowd handling. stand my ground in hard negotations. take in a lot of negative feedback and deal with some failures. There were a lot of times when I felt like running away from the problem but the beauty of this PoR is that it won‚Äôt let you. Even when you‚Äôre tired. or tied by administration or resource constrained and super close to giving up. It has definitely increased my self-confidence to stand up to any problem in the world with a - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre TechSoc. we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù attitude.

Being part of something bigger - I had a chance to stand for a strong tech culture at my college - even though it sometimes meant being unhealthily altruistic. Looking back. I‚Äôll have not regretted that I spent my last year complaining about not having a strong tech scene at univer. I‚Äôll carry with me the legacy of having led highly passionate believers who wanted to push the limits of what technology can be.

The De-merits

passing out after 40hrs on non stop competition work and logistics
Constantly stressed - In the early days. especially with the offline shift and even during the competitions. I felt responsible for too many things. It‚Äôs an unprecedented level of stress - that no one should rationally take. Passion might be good reason to do it. but not otherwise. You‚Äôre worried for an event. a team member‚Äôs growth. someone resigning. some plan getting delayed and simultaneously 0 participation in another event on the next day. Since the team is small. unlike other bodies. you‚Äôre involved personally in most things and while the growth is good - the cost it comes at. is also high
Personal sacrifices - Barely any time on most weekends. I remember just bouncing across meetings post 8pm on a lot of weekdays and then standing by the team. I‚Äôve missed a lot of social life. sometimes even personal goals (heck. I didn‚Äôt work on my startup during national competitions) and relaxing. as I struggled to move the needles of 3 different verticals whilst the cores were still warming up. The role does take a lot out of you and it‚Äôs not a good thing always.
A lot of ground-work - My leadership style has always been more hands-on. Might be a good or bad thing. I don‚Äôt know the balance. There are days when people won‚Äôt work upto your standards and you‚Äôll have to step in and help even though you really are just mad and might want to panic and yell at them to get it done. Compassion taught me to share the load - right from being a TShirt distributor to a sweeper to poster designer to food delivery agent.
A crazy story
I'll tell a story of how I learnt persistence. In 2023. I was leading a 90 member contingent from our university to participate in Inter IIT Tech Meet (a national level competition for solving technical challenges). I was managing 15 projects over 2 months and was also in charge of the logistics. travel and accommodation in Kanpur. I booked the train tickets for my contingent through our institute and they assured us of tickets to Kanpur. However. in on the day of travel. amidst 100+ things I juggled all the way upto the train station. I realized that our tickets from Chennai to Kanpur were waitlisted. The train was full and keeping in mind the safety of my team. I told them to get off and said we'd find another way. And so. this story begins with a huge group ¬†of people. staring down at me at 12am on a railway station. with hopes that I'd get them to our competition - 2000 miles away - in the next 36 hours.

I arranged for a bus back to the campus and stayed up till 3. trying to figure out how I'd get my team to Kanpur safely. with the limited budget I had. For context. our institute had a no-flight refund policy for competitions. We brainstormed multiple routes via permutations of bus and train but we'd reach late and fatigued. At 3:15am. Shreepoorna found a reasonable flight ticket deal from Chennai to Delhi. At 3:30am. I poured in all my personal savings of about INR 85000 (with a INR 10000 loan) and booked the tickets to Kanpur. Here's the celebration video of that too.


the moment the tickets for kanpur were booked at 3:30am (gut feeling- all these people are going to make great founders 1 day)
Next. I spent 2 hours breaking it to the 2 people. whose tickets couldn't be booked due to limited funds. At 4am. I was standing at Cauvery Hostel. getting rattled by a junior on how I'd failed my entire purpose as a leader. Returning to my room in a mess. I wrote a long email to the Dean. explaining the situtation before I passed out.

After a 1 hr nap. I woke up in cold sweats. informing our Dean with a long email - the entire situation. 9am. I showed up to their office. shaking. But the admin rallied with us and with their support. got the tickets for the remaining team as well.

After 2 hours we flew to Delhi. In-flight. I worked with the people solving the "entrepreneurship challenge" and got their submission right. Abhishek Gupta (on campus) was making the pitch deck all the way to 12 when we submitted it. before we finally got kicked out of the cafe we made our makeshift office. with just a single coffee order. Next. at Delhi. we haggled and arranged bus transport to Kanpur for all with a 40% discount. Turns out. back then. online bookings weren't considered valid and you had to physically haggle and get people in the bus.

Fun fact. we got screwed over by the bus guys who dropped us about 25km away and once again. stranded on a highway at 7am. our team is bargaining with auto drivers to get us there.

Finally. after the entire long journey. we reached Kanpur campus 10 hours before time. 24 hours after that. with a parched throat. I pitched and won the silver medal for my college at the entrepreneurship challenge. Oh and the savings I put in? I got them reimbursed a month later by tweaking around my cloud provider SaaS costs and showing AWS credits as expenditure (technically. I did lose the money).

This is my favourite story that I like to share as I can neither put it in my resume nor will it be a conventional interview question - but it is so fundamental to my way of working - Persistence. I'd rather sweat in a garage than recline in a cabin. Cause where other's see unconvention. I see genius. "Ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. are the ones who really do"

Here's another story blog I wrote about an initiative TechSoc created and ran - to motivate students to believe and build projects - link

Coolest things I got to do

Okay so this post is not actually about college ragging but majorly about Retrieval Generated Augmentation (RAG). a cool machine learning and indexing application I came across while building CloudPilot - "the copilot for cloud engineers"

What is CloudPilot? ‚úàÔ∏è
CloudPilot was a project we built with the vision of going from idea to cloud within 10 minutes.

The goal of the project was to enable any thinker to start with a business problem. quickly to research and come up with a wholesome engineering document that had the solution approach. its architecture and performance analysis done well in under 10 minutes.

This product was built at a hackathon in under 24 hours. Let me know if there are any improvements you want me to look at.

And with that. let's dive in. into the product flow



What does a cloud engineer do?
First. let's understand how cloud architects function and come up with infrastructure solutions for a given business problem. See. as a typical cloud architect - the flow is as follows

Step 0: - It starts with a problem statement such as a architecture for payment gateway or a data migration pipeline or a high availability server fleet setup.
Step 1: Ask the right questions - Several times. we go back and forth with the problem statement to understand what are the exact business requirements and what are important aspects that we need to optimize for.
Step 2: Research - With the given requirements. the standard approach is to go online. read up some blogs by cloud providers. read case studies and open source articles to get context and understand our problem statement. Here. typically a lot of time is just spent in finding the right article. Most software problems have precedents that have solved the requirement wholly or in parts. Hence. finding the right documentation for similar requirements is of paramount importance.
Step 3: Technical Requirements - Once we have asked the right questions. we prepare a brief technical document. highlighting the most important performance expectations from the software and then start researching what kind of cloud offerings do we require. We also quantify that to what extent do we want to look at satisfying a particular goal. eg: 500 TB of storage. 80ms latency in communication. 7 0s of availability. 8GB GPUs for ML training.
Step 4: List the building blocks - Here. we simply map each techinal requirement to an existing cloud service we can use and do a comparative analysis. If it's ML. it's gotta be Google Cloud. for availability and cost. it's gotta be AWS - that kinda thing. So we start listing cloud offerings such as EC2 (AWS). Maps API (Google Cloud) or Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Azure). We think of using these offerings as builing blocks for the entire architecture and justify why the offering is important
Step 5: Join the blocks - Here. we join together the building blocks as services that communicate with 1 another and draw a systems diagram that helps to understand how the overall system works. Which part does what function and how it's role fits into the overall requirement.
Step 6: Iterate - Once an end-to-end flow is ready. we do overall Product. Engineering and Cost Analysis and then we iterate upon the design to optimize for certain aspects - make it faster. make it cheaper. increase the storage. increase the redundancy - that kind of thing. And based on that. we improve the choice of building blocks and integrating them together in 1 system
Step 7: Templatize - Once a cloud architecture is ready. we start looking at using Cloud templates such as CloudFormation by AWS. Terraform by Hashicorp to easily just deploy the entire architecture and have a skeleton of it functional to understand performance on a practical level.
Thus. this is the overall flow of the entirety of coming up with a cloud architecture. Beautiful and methodical.

So if we were to copilotize this process we would need an AI agent who could read through all cloud architecture related blogs. docs. case-studies like an engineer and intuitively go through steps 1 to 8 and help arrive upon a solution.

And that's why we used something called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique where we retrieved the right list of documents from the internet and asked our Large Language Model to generate an answer from text that it studied from these docs.

Before we segway into what we did. let's study in short - what is this "Retrieval Augmented Generation" anyways?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)


Imagine you're a chef and you're trying to create a new dish. First. you go to your pantry (which has a vast array of ingredients). This is akin to the retrieval part. You take a look at different recipes you have used in the past or a recipe book for ideas. You fetch or 'retrieve' ingredients and inspiration based on these recipes.

Next. you start to combine these ingredients together. perhaps in a way you've never done before. You might modify some of the recipes to match your taste or to make the dish unique. This is similar to the 'generation' part of the process.

Now. let's say you have some guests coming over and you know their preferences. To accommodate them. you decide to modify your new dish even further or add some garnish to make it look more appealing. This is comparable to the 'augmentation' part. where you make some tweaks to make the final result better suited for its purpose.

Bringing it back to the context of AI and natural language processing. Retrieval-Generated Augmentation is a method where you:

'Retrieve' relevant data or content from a large dataset (like a chef searching through the pantry or recipe books).
'Generate' new data or content based on this retrieved data (like a chef creating a new dish using the fetched ingredients). and then
'Augment' this generated content. usually by making some modifications to better suit the task at hand (like a chef adjusting the dish to suit the guests' taste).
This method is very useful for tasks that involve generating text or other types of data. especially when you want to produce content that is tailored for a specific task. purpose. or audience.

It's also a way to improve the performance of machine learning models. by providing them with a richer. more varied dataset to learn from. The richer and more varied the 'ingredients' (i.e.. the data). the better the 'dish' (i.e.. the model's output) can potentially be.



How we built the damn thing
Part 1: "Retrieve"
For this we would leverage the open-source documents. blogs. systems diagrams and articles by major Cloud Providers such as AWS. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

We created a custom index of just these documents. Using Amazon Kendra. we indexed over 192000 such information webpages using its web-connector. Here. the major difficulty we faced was understanding which XML sitemaps did we have to index and how. Some documents were in Japanese and some were just plain irrelevant marketing content. So intelligent document structure filtering was required at this level to index the right documents for our search.

Thus. this helped us to get the best documents to pull in for a given query. For example the queries below.




Using Kendra for getting top documents for a given search query
Part 2: "Generate"
Alright so you've got the top 10 documents you're supposed to refer to. But how can we improve the experience of gleaning valuable insights for your given business problem? That's where we use the superpower of an LLM. It's like asking it to read all documents and answer over it

So. once we "retrieve" the documents from Amaz√∏n Kendra. we ask the LLM to take the top 5 most relevant documents. pass all the text in them as tokens to the LLM (number of tokens varies depending on the LLM. we used GPT-4 by OpenAI that takes in upto 8000 tokens). The LLM parses the text and via few-shot learning over the context of business problem and the documents from Kendra. "generates" a response for the end user.

This is the simple task. Get the relevant docs and then generate a textual response from the same. Let's improve the experience now.



Part 3: The end-to-end architecture
Stringing together this in an entire experience involved developing the following flow.

Get the input prompt for the business requirement from the user and generate a set of relevant questions about the business to ask the user. For this we used an LLM


We recorded the question answers and the business requirement. did some text summarization and trimming (using nltk to remove whitespaces. punctuations etc.) and then we pass it all as a cumulative context for searching best documents in Amazon Kendra

Next. we get the best docuements from Amazon Kendra as text. combine that with business prompt and QnA and pass it to our LLM for giving a textual response

Once we get the response. we return that. along with hyperlinks to the documents that Kendra returned so the user can get our summarized.structured answer as well as refer the source documents for more information at their own leisure

To help the cloud engineer with more specific information. we added a feature to generate the following from the textual answer
6. Systems diagram for the architecture proposed to understand how to link together the building blocks
7. IaaC code template - Basically a CloudFormation code template to quickly just spin up the architecture and study its performance and behavior in cloud
8. Cost estimation - based on information that the LLM has been trained on. using AWS pricing docs as data source

Lastly. we provided a chat interface for the user to keep passing more requirements (such as "make it cheaper?". "make the system faster?") to the service. Now. we pass a combination of these 4 things to the LLM to get an improved answer = original business prompt + QnA + generated answer + additional user request



What can we improve upon?
Here's the current complete system that was built:



Okay so this project was awesomely exciting but the main complaint I have from it is that it is too slow. It still takes 2 minutes to generate answers and diagrams. A way to improve that would be some compute on frontend or some level of caching

Also. the answers are still generic and unless the prompt is well-engineered. we wouldn't discover novel architectures and solutions. So. that's something we need to fine-tune for. Maybe some sort of a framework for the user to engineer their prompt even better. Asking better technical requirement questions for a given business prompt could be a good starting point.

Lastly. it's expensive. Kendra is expensive and so is using OpenAI. So the approach for solving this is - open-source it! A search index with Elasticsearch combined with a custom LLM such as the Llama. Lima and Flan-T5 models can help cut down on costs

Oooh. a cool feature could have also using voice to speech and language translation (with using localized cloud services docs) to provide multilingual support to our beloved copilot

In closing....
We're having a copilot for pretty much everything these days ever since the Generative AI hype cycle started so I just thought of creating something that could help engineers to better adopt the Cloud Services by any cloud and help leverage them in the best possible way

I'd rather sweat in a garage then recline in a cabin
The story for this starts with wanting to figure out how a student can get from point A in skillset to point B in skillset (their desired ambition) - given an educational ecosystem that provides certain opportunities. And we did realize it. atleast for 3000+ students in my undergraduate college.

I ran Coursepanel for a year and we built several cool things in this journey. I'll keep this blog fairly technical but also throw in certain snippets about entrepreneurship and lessons learnt along the way. Most of this blog is going to be about the technical implementation of this project. I have mentioned my learnings as an entrepreneur in the end.

To read the story of the early days and launch. checkout - here


Technical Deep-dive
Understanding Natural Language Processing and Vector Embeddings
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science. artificial intelligence. and linguistics. It involves programming computers to effectively process large amounts of natural language data. As part of NLP. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. developed by OpenAI. are designed to generate human-like text based on the inputs they receive. They are trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate contextually relevant text.

However. they do not know specific documents or sources they were trained on and don't have the capability to access or retrieve specific documents or databases during the generation process. Their strength lies in understanding and generating text that closely resembles human-like responses. thus forming a key part of systems like CourseGPT.

Vector embeddings are another crucial component of such systems. In the realm of machine learning. embeddings are a way to convert categorical variables into continuous vectors so as to feed them into a model. They can be used to capture the semantics of words in a language. relationships between items. and even user behavior in an application.


Basic demo of how words are converted into vector embeddings (source)

These embeddings. when stored in a vector database. form the basis of effective search and recommendation systems.

Building a vector database using a knowledge graph
For the purpose of this project. based on the previous training data. we turned our knowledge graph (aka ‚Äúskillmap‚Äù) into a vector database for storing entries and answering queries related to academic data. This was done in 4 steps:

Creating a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j: The first step involved modeling our data as a graph and storing it in Neo4j. Our nodes represent entities such as NPTEL courses. books. departments. etc.. and relationships represented the connections between these entities
Generating Vector Embeddings: The next step involved generating vector embeddings from our graph. These embeddings are a form of representation that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of your data in the form of vectors in a high-dimensional space. There are several techniques to generate graph embeddings. like Node2Vec. GraphSAGE. etc. This project used the Node2Vec library in Python to achieve the same. We ran Node2Vec algorithms on our Neo4j graph to generate node and relationship embeddings.
Store Vector Embeddings: The generated embeddings then needed to be stored for future use. Typically. we‚Äôd want a database that is optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. You could use a vector database like Pinecone. Faiss. or even Elasticsearch with a vector plugin for this purpose.
Querying the Vector Database: The final part involved using these vector embeddings to make our application smarter. For example. we could now perform operations like semantic search. recommendations. or similarity checks by comparing vectors. This involved querying our vector database for the nearest vectors to a given input vector. which gave us the most semantically similar entities to our query.
Scoping NPTEL data into the Vector Database and building a chatbot
To create a system like CourseGPT. we first need to load the relevant data into the vector database. Let's assume we have course data from NPTEL in a CSV format. This data can be processed and converted into vector embeddings using various techniques like Word2Vec. GloVe. or even using transformers-based models. These vector representations can then be loaded into the vector database. which allows us to perform efficient similarity search operations.

The vector database enables us to compare the query vector (which can be a representation of a user's query or a specific course interest) with all vectors in our database. and retrieves the most similar entries. These entries represent courses that are most relevant to the user's query.

Once the entries are returned. we need to translate these course vectors back into a human-readable form. This is where LLMs like GPT-3 come into play. These models can generate contextually relevant. human-like text based on the returned entries. The generated text can be as simple as a course name and description. or as complex as a detailed career path recommendation.

In this way. the synergy of NLP. LLMs. and vector databases leads to the development of an effective system like CourseGPT. Such a system can revolutionize the way we approach professional upskilling and corporate training by providing personalized. contextual. and interactive learning experiences.

The journey in a nutshell
The development and evolution of CourseGPT. spread over a 12-month period. could've been a significant step forward in the application of advanced technologies such as AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP). and Knowledge Graphs to the critical area of professional upskilling and corporate training.

The journey began with understanding the problem domain. setting the objectives and scope. and constructing the methodology flowchart. The decision to pick a test sandbox environment of similar nature proved instrumental in aligning the development of CourseGPT closely with the real-world challenges encountered in professional learning and development.

Deep dives into models of corporate training. specifically the Kirkpatrick Model. provided insights into the metrics for successful training outcomes. Skill mapping using a knowledge graph emerged as a novel and efficient approach to resolving course recommendations and facilitating an effective learning journey for the students.

Working with the NPTEL team and building a skill map for IIT Madras underscored the potential of this tool in academic environments as well. Implementing Natural Entity Recognition and NLP allowed us to extract valuable course tags and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Moreover. the research conducted at HyperVerge Academy (HVA) enabled a deeper understanding of the professional upskilling space. Facing and overcoming various challenges along the way. we succeeded in developing a competency engine and data model that significantly enriched the capabilities of CourseGPT.

Finally. CourseGPT emerged as an intelligent product. leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to recommend courses based on career goals. plan academic journeys. solve student doubts. and inclusively cater to diverse learners. The journey. although filled with complexities and challenges. offered valuable insights into the future of AI-enabled learning and set a foundation for ongoing research and development.

Here's the various launch videos of products that I built. just as a nostalgic flash from the past.





Why I failed to run it as a company.
With Coursepanel. we made around 35000 INR in revenue with 3000+ free users and then got stuck in a loop of developing without continuous customer interaction. I shut down Coursepanel in May 2023. I was embarassed. mentally disturbed and self-doubting when I did it. It was hard and it was like I had given up on a dream ¬†and failed myself. But picking up and moving on is the way forward. Here are a few things I learnt from this experience - these aren't novel learnings - these are the same fuckups most startup folks advise against but I did it anyway and learnt it again - at a heavy price:

Don't do it alone. It's not that I'm doubting individual capability - it's just that context switching has a very difficult toll when you ¬†want strong velocity in both business and innovaiton. Also there's the emotional burden of doing it alone. Worst case. atleast have a friend to talk to and help sort out a lot of operations and communications
It's best to build a shitty product with continuous customer interaction but no point of siloed building. no matter what you feel about current systems. Even asking and then building then again asking then building - i.e. an intermittent month-to-month setup might not help. Atleast talk to users each week.
Make money from the start. It's the only way to stay afloat.
Don't get to emotionally attached to your innovation or amazed by exciting new things you can do. Focus on the minimum that gets you paid. get it right and then expand with bolder experiments.
It's boring and requires discipline and routine to continuously outperform other teams. You have to consistently just keep pushing. Motivation is 2/3rds of this game.

So yeah. I guess that's about it. I was very passionate. worked very hard and was heartbroken - but I guess I'm carrying forward a lot - something that classroom would have never taught me. Let's see. I'm about to do something again in the Generative AI space. This time - business first though - get the "what are people gonna pay for" right and then expand from that base thought into technical innovation and exquisite design.

Problems define markets
Having a more accurate understanding of the market in which your product is really competing
A market is not tied to any specific solutions that meet those needs. That is why you see ‚Äúmarket disruptions‚Äù: when a new type of product (solution space) better meets the market needs (problem space)
The ‚Äúwhat‚Äù describes the benefits that the product should give the customer‚Äîwhat the product will accomplish for the user or allow the user to accomplish.
The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the way in which the product delivers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to the customer. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is problem space and ‚Äúhow‚Äù is solution space.
üí°
What = problem space
How = solution space
Lean product teams articulate the hypotheses they have made and solicit customer feedback on early design ideas to test those hypotheses.

Should you listen to customers?
It‚Äôs true that customers aren‚Äôt going to lead you to the Promised Land of a break-through innovative product. but customer feedback is like a flashlight in the night: it keeps you from falling off a cliff as you try to find your way there.

Using the solution space to discover the problem space
Hard for customers to talk about abstract benefits and the relative importance of each‚Äîand when they do. it‚Äôs often fraught with inaccuracies
This can be solved by techniques like "contextual inquiry" or "customer discovery"
The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. If you show them a new product or design. they can tell you what they like and don‚Äôt like. They can compare it to other solutions and identify pros and cons.
The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created
Divergent and convergent thinking
You should be practicing divergent thinking. which means trying to generate as many ideas as possible without any judgment or evalua-tion. There will be plenty of time later for convergent thinking. where you evaluate the ideas and decide which ones you think are the most promising.

you want to capture all the ideas that your team generated. then organize them by the benefit that they deliver.
Then. for each benefit. you want to review and prioritize the list of feature ideas.
You can score each idea on expected customer value to determine a first-pass priority.
The goal is to identify the top three to five features for each benefit.
There is not much value in looking beyond those top features right now because things will change‚Äîa lot‚Äîafter you show your prototype to customers.
A user story is a brief description of the benefit that the particular functionality should provide. including whom the benefit is for (the target customer). and why the customer wants the benefit.

üí°
As a [type of user]. I want to [do something]. so that I can [desired benefit].
¬†eg : As a professional photographer.I want to easily upload pictures from my camera to my website.so that I can quickly show my clients their pictures. ¬†

üí°
INVEST framework
I - independent of other stories
N - not explicit and must be flexible. open for discussion
V - valuable to customer
E - reasonlaby estimate scope
S - small
T - testable
¬†

Small tickets and smaller ticket batch sizes are better
Break tickets into atomic chunks. Trim extra stuff
The batch size is the number of products worked on together at the same time in parallel. Faster velocity of small batches -> faster feedback -> reduce risk and waste
The longer you work on a product with-out getting customer feedback. the more you risk a major disconnect that subsequently requires significant rework.
Scoping with story points
Story points - type of currency for estimating relative ticket size
Have a max threshold for story points
Good operating principle ¬†- break down stories with high points into smaller stories
Return on investment to prioritize
When you are building a product or feature. the investment is usually the time that your development resources spend working on it. which you generally measure in units such as developer-weeks (one developer working for one week).
It‚Äôs true that you could probably calculate an equivalent dollar amount. but people use units like developer-weeks because they are simpler and clearer
Visualizing ROI

Good product teams strive to come up with ideas like idea G in Figure 6.1‚Äîthe ones that create high customer value for low effort.
Great product teams are able to take ideas like that. break them down into chunks. trim off less valuable pieces. and identify creative ways to deliver the customer value with less effort than initially scoped‚Äîindicated in the figure by moving idea G to the left.
The accuracy of the estimates should be proportional to the fidelity of the product definition
The main point of these calculations is less about figuring out actual ROI values and more about how they compare to each other
¬†

Approximating ROI and Deciding on MVP candidate

Just comparing feature importance wrt one another. Once that‚Äôs done. arrange all features in this format as per benefit categories


Intentionally give them generic names so that you can more easily envision replacing them with what would be relevant for your product. ‚ÄúM1A‚Äù means feature chunk A for must-have 1. ‚ÄúP2B‚Äù means feature chunk B for perfor-mance benefit 2. and ‚ÄúD2C‚Äù means feature chunk C for delighter benefit 21.
Decide on the MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONALITY that will resonate with TG users
Look down the leftmost column of feature chunks and determine which ones you think need to be in your MVP candidate. While doing so. you should refer to your product value proposition
After this. focus on the main performance benefit you‚Äôre planning to use to beat the competition
Delighters are part of your differentiation. too. You should include your top delighter in your MVP candidate.
So if you‚Äôve made tentative plans beyond your MVP. you must be prepared to throw them out the window and come up with new plans based on what you learn from customers.

Moving on to MVP and early Prototyping
Use the broad term MVP ‚Äúprototype‚Äù to capture the wide range of items you can test with cus-tomers to gain learning. While the first ‚Äúprototype‚Äù you test could be your live MVP. you can gain faster learning with fewer resources by testing your hypotheses before you build your MVP.

What is/isn't an MVP?

There has been spirited debate over what qualifies as an MVP. Some people argue vehemently that a landing page is a valid MVP. Others say it isn‚Äôt. insisting that an MVP must be a real. working product or at least an interactive prototype.
The way I resolve this dichotomy is to realize that these are all methods to test the hypotheses behind your MVP. By using the term ‚ÄúMVP tests‚Äù instead of MVP. the debate goes away
Product vs Marketing MVP Tests

Marketing test - You‚Äôre simply describing the functionality to prospective customers to see how compelling they find your description
MVP Tests - validate your product will involve showing prospective customers functionality to solicit their feedback on it. You may be showing them a live beta product or just low fidelity wireframes to assess product-market fit
Marketing tests can provide valuable learning. but they‚Äôre not an actual product that creates customer value. At some point. you need to test a prototype of your MVP candidate
Quantitative vs Qualitative MVP Tests

Qualitative - you are talking with customers directly. usually in small numbers that don‚Äôt yield statistical significance eg: If. for example. you conducted one-on-one feedback sessions with 12 prospective customers to solicit their feedback on a mockup of your landing page. then that would be qualitative research

Quantitative - conducting the test at scale with alarge number of customers. ¬†You don‚Äôt care as much about any indi-vidual result and are instead interested in the aggregate results.

eg: If you launched two versions of your landing page and directed thousands of customers to each one to see which one had the higher conversion rate. then that would be a quantitative test.

Quant = what. how; Qual = why

Quantitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many‚Äù: what actions customers took and how many customers took an action (e.g.. clicked on the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button). But quantitative tests will not tell you why they chose to do so or why the other customers chose not to do so. In contrast. qualitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: the reasons behind different customers‚Äô decisions to take an action or not.

If you don't know where you're going. you might not get there
Objective Key-Result (OKR) is a framework of approaching a goal/project that ensures that you and your team make 1000s of decisions and steps. while being aligned on a common vision.

This blog will largely explore the key learnings I've gathered from this awesome book on the topic called "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. If you're curious. this person learnt the OKR framework from top management at Intel and replicated successfully. the same principles - at Google and grew the young startup at breakneck speed with people and products - whilst retaining the core vision of making information easily accessible to all.

The very 1st slide John showed to team Google said OKRS: "A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization"

I'll litter this blog with excerpts and stories that the book explored and I found most helpful.

OKR short intro
Objective is the WHAT is to bo achieved. These are significant. concrete. action oriented and ideally inspirational.

Key Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound. aggressive yet reliastic. Most of all they're measurable and reliable.

Where an objective can be long-lived. rolled over for a year or longer. key results evolve as the work progresses. Once the KRs are completed -> the objective is achieved

Thus. OKRs channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse ops. lending purpose and unity to the entire org. This is supremely important at startups or young companies where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction

The maker of OKR
Andy Grove. an Intel exec is credited for having created the management system of OKRs when Intel had taken up the responsibility of Operation Crush - a race to win in the 16-bit microprocessor market with their 8086 product in a time where cheaper and less performant products were eating market share.

It was the glorious story of how Intel dumped the business of memory-chip and went all-in on microprocessors and completely "crushed" every other contemporary compute company.

Here. are the 1st tenets of this system. by Dr. Grove himself:

Less is more
Set goals from the bottom up
No dictating
Stay flexible
Dare to fail

Great companies take the surplus cash flows created by their sustainable competitive advantages and then either return those to shareholders or reinvest those in their core franchise or - and this is the litmus test of greatness - reinvest those successfully in new activities or markets
"Unusual Billionaires". by Saurabh Mukherjea. is an unusually riveting & practical thesis. It is a collection of stories of brilliant companies that made their dent in the world by continuously innovating. providing great service. and building powerful teams & stable assets. It teaches us the unconventional yet core fundamental process of sustainably building great companies amidst this era of venture-backed rocketship dreams.

In this blog I'll be listing snippets from the book. that teach us all. the values of how great companies our built and share my thoughts on the same. ¬†In this market of the recession of fly-high crashes of crypto exchanges. the gloom of overpowering AI agents & plummeting stock prices. I think we can all take a page out of these learnings & realize how lasting services are created.

Asian paints
Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness. it turns out. is largely a matter of conscious choice. ~ Jim Collins (Good to great)
An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire ~ Yuval Nova Harari
A great company attracts the best talent. commands respect in the business community and. more often than not. trades at a premium in the stock market
Greatness is meant to be an enduring quality. Stock prices are an effect and not a cause of a company‚Äôs greatness
Metrics in a great company
Revenue growth of 10% and ROCE of 15% every year for non-financial services companies
Loan book growth of 15% and ROE of 15% every year for financial services companies
‚ÄúWe have consciously stuck to a sector which is growing and offers decent potential and have always strived for excellence across all functional areas. But it is not because somebody is observing us and is going to applaud us. We have just stuck to our knitting sensibly as the sector has evolved over decades - Jalaj Dani (promoter)
By obsessively using tech and talent to improve on internal processes and efficiencies. these companies put considerable distance between themselves and the competitions. In particular. this focus on efficiency and cost reduction helps the champion companies sustain high levels of profitability in a way that most of their rivals simply can‚Äôt match
Create and nurture an environment in which a multitude of talented minds work in harmony so that mutual competence is reinforcing rather than debilitating
IBAS framework - Innovation. Brands & rep. architecture. strategic assets
Innovation - shopkeeper would get 3.5% extra discount. if. without fail. he made payments on time throughout the year. adoption of computers & GPS
Brands & rep - Asian Paints changed their messaging to maintain an emotional connection with their target audience. Thus came the brand ambassador of a mischievous kid with a can of paint (name - ‚ÄúGattu‚Äù)
Architecture - Creating a truly independent board of directors to help shape evolution of the firm. Rapid career progression for those who perform with job rotation at reg. intervals.
Empowerment allows creativity. It‚Äôs about the feeling of being a family - Jalaj Dani
Strategic assets - sources of competitive advantages - intellectual property. licences. regulatory permissions. access to natural resources and natural monopolies
On the trust Asian paints built - ‚Äú50% of dealers won‚Äôt check their accounts. despite having access to a web portal which gives them real time updates on their accounts‚Äù
Berger
The most difficult thing to change at a company is to change its people

Don‚Äôt recruit someone who is not able to do a job. just to fill a vacancy. Secondly. even if we don‚Äôt have a job. but you come across the right person. you must recruit him

In FY13. talent and skill are increasingly becoming scarce and it requires considerable effort to identify. engage and retain such talents. The report also added that salary alone is not the criteria for satisfaction of deserving employees and that the firm needs to offer a participative work environment and an open culture

Marico
I strongly believe that culture can be a source of competitive advantage in an org and it is impossible to copy. The org‚Äôs culture is a major driving force in the execution of strategy. Correct culture helps in proper execution of strategy by helping everyone align on the same page (Mariwala)
A promoter supporting and listening to the board. although being a 60 percent shareholder. makes indep directors feel proud because we think that we are able to contribute to Marico. These things don‚Äôt reflect directly on the balance sheet. P&L or share price. but these are inputs which go into creation of long-term shareholder wealth
Page
Many companies justify risking balance sheet & profits for fueling growth. However. Page has maintained steadfast financial discipline whilst expanding its operations and at the same time. its share prices have also kept up an upward trend
‚ÄòOur managers understand that it‚Äôs not about having power but about how you empower your subordinates & bring about the best results from your team members. Hence each member behaves like a leader and that gives us a winning culture - Sunder Genomal
‚ÄòFrom day one. Mr Genomal has pushed us into adopting a process-oriented approach. Almost everything we do at Page is part of an Excel sheet.
‚ÄòWe want to keep our distributors‚Äô balance sheets healthy because our business is dependent on their finances. If they have the wrong inventory stuck with them. it neither helps us nor them
Even the core projects will not be taken up unless they promise an ROCE of atleast 20%
Axis bank
Hemant Kaul on Supriya Gupta - My offer letter from Axis Bank had no details about compensation. But the temptation to start a new bank with Gupta overshadowed all my inhibitions - On joining Axis
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in a commodity business. the only way to thrive is to be a low-cost producer. And when you‚Äôre selling money. you‚Äôre in a commodity business - Duff McDonald
Shikha Sharma - I advise other companies‚Äô CEOs not to fall into the trap where you go - Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth - They feel a tremendous pressure to grow. Well. sometimes you can‚Äôt grow. Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to grow. In certain businesses. growth means you either take on bad clients. excess risk or too much leverage - Jamie Dimon (CEO of JPMC)
The shift from people to processes was critical as the bank was moving away from reliance on corporate banking to retail banking (which needs very high use of data & analytics based decision making to grow the business whilst maintaining commercial viability
This operating structure makes the CEO of a pvt bank both less powerful than a promoter of a non-bank company but more influential than the CEO of a non-bank company (pg 209)
Employee policies are very consistent at Axis Bank and there is little ambiguity and subjectivity in the pay hikes and bonuses. All supervisors have to clearly explain the ratings they assign to their subordinates - something that decides pay rise. promotion & bonus. You won‚Äôt find this in other pvt sector banks. where a lot of randomness prevails in salary hikes. bonuses & promotions where lower rated employees have got higher bonuses
HDFC bank
Building a visionary company requires 1% vision & 99% alignment - Jim Collins
An org‚Äôs ability to learn & translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive advantage - Jack Welch
HDFC Bank‚Äôs strength rests not so much on the uniqueness of tech it uses but in the way that tech is lined up in a clever process flow i.e. not envisaged by other banks.
Strong focus on systems & procedures meant that the people who succeeded them did not find it difficult to take over responsibilities quickly
Astral
We came to a point where our day to day business was to just survive. Sandeep Engineer
We had to build scale. We made the market for CPVC in India and if we didn‚Äôt increase capacities aggressively. someone else would have borne the fruit of our hard work. Sandeep Engineer
Instead of copying foreign technologies. Engineer forged technical partnerships with global majors to launch innovative products in India
His biggest strength is simplicity and humility. There has been no change in his personality even after the manifold growth of Astral. He still drinks tea from a roadside stall along with his dealers
Engineer would tell plumbers not to see themselves as plumbers. but as doctors who treat the big problem of leaking pipes in homes
Greatness is not Everyone‚Äôs Cup of Tea
Strategy is about making smart choices and execution is about relentless implementation ~ Phil Rosenzweig
The business of business is a lot of little decisions every day mixed up with a few big decisions ~ Tom Murphy
Those who achieve long-lasting success in India are often those who are unflashy . introverted. determined. and intelligently tenacious
Rahul Dravid‚Äôs of the business world - rare. determined and constantly seeking to improve the edge or the advantage they enjoy vis-a-vis their competitors
What makes a great company:
Theme A - Focus on the long term (more than ten years) without being distracted by short-term gambles
Theme B - Constantly deepen the moat around the core franchise using the IBAS framework
Theme C - Sensibly allocate capital whilst studiously avoiding betting the balance sheet on expensive and unrelated forays
Ability to steadfastly focus on doing the same thing for decades on end whilst gradually strengthening their franchise. generating surplus cash from that endeavour and then giving much of that back to shareholders whilst reinvesting the rest judiciously
Ram Charan - Leaders who say ‚ÄúI have got ten priorities‚Äù don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about
Jim Collins(Great by Choice. 2011) - 20 Mile March requires hitting specified performance markers with great consistency over a long period of time. It requires 2 distinct types of discomfort. delivering high performance in difficult times and holding back in good times
Good management teams work on proving a concept before investing a lot of capital. They are not likely to put a lot of money in all at once. hoping for a big payoff - Michael Shearn
Firstly. diversifications if any. are consciously restrained. instead of breaking or stretching the balance sheet. Secondly. surplus cash. when available. is returned to shareholders when in can‚Äôt be effectively deployed without dragging the ROCE down sharply. Whilst all of this might sound straightforward. these axioms are rarely implemented by Indian promoters who all too often treat their listed companies as their personal fiefdoms and short-change the minority shareholders
A company‚Äôs profitability increases as it moves up the value addition chain
Competitive advantage - if value added is the difference between the cost of a company‚Äôs inputs and that of its output. then competitive advantage allows a company to add more value than its rivals. Furthermore. a sustainable competitive advantage enables a company to continue sustaining this extra value addition over long periods of time
Unless innovation becomes a process which a firm lives day in and day out. the firm will appear impressive initially. and then ultimately disappoint. A product can be quickly outdated. but a successful brand is timeless

What is Back of the envelope?
A Back of the envelope calculation is a simple arithmetic operation frequently carried out on a little piece of paper. like an envelope. Back of the envelope analysis quickly generates a ballpark figure using approximated or rounded figures. An estimate is more accurate than a wild guess but less exact than a formal calculation using precise numbers in a spreadsheet or other program. These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.

In honor of physicist Enrico Fermi. back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.

In this article. we will talk about this methodology's history. applications. and best practices. Furthermore. I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations. Just a disclaimer - the calculations that are about to be added. are made with heavy assumptions - looking at Twitter 2.0 as a new service that we‚Äôll be building & basic components required for the same. The calculations don‚Äôt involve considerations of economies of scale. redundancy. replication and most estimations that involve scaling. We are just understanding a basic implementation of storage for the app. for the scale it is it


Twitter 2.0‚Äôs System Design diagram shared by Elon Musk in November 2022 - Source

Why are back of the envelope calculations needed?
The calculation generally informs us if the design can satisfy the functional requirements. such as the number of supported users. response latency. and resource needs. For instance. when deciding between different architectural designs. the simplest question to ask is whether one server is enough. To get a ballpark figure. we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require. if not one.

Notable Industry Applications
Some of the use cases where back of the envelope calculation has been used:

An important Internet protocol. the Border Gateway Protocol. was sketcBeforein 1989 by engineers on the back of "three ketchup-stained napkins". and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.
UTF-8. the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.
The Bailey bridge is a type of portable. pre-fabricated. truss bridge and was extensively used by British. Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.
The Laffer Curve. which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income. was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.
We've looked at some of the important historical applications of the back of the envelope. now we'll examine the arithmetic process to see how we can utilise it to solve our own issues. This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.

Getting Started with Back of the Envelope
Whenever we try to learn something new. we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly. when beginning system design estimations. we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers. used for estimating the speed of a system. are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency. as a term. helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example. the latency of the best video chat applications. such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.

How can we implement this?
Before approximating the real utilization. we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance. we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.

How can we guess the real usage?

The utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and. if necessary. further divided) and combined.

For instance. we might anticipate 1K active users. each of whom submits 15 requests daily.

15K requests per day. or 15K/86400 requests per second. are involved.

An effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly. Nobody likes to multiply by 86400. To give 0.2 seconds to serve a single request. let's round to 20K/100K. We need to set up at least 4 computers if we know that it takes 0.7 seconds to serve one request. Of course. you don't want to live on the edge. so let's increase the number of machines by a buffer and make it ten.

How to calculate quickly
If someone asked you to calculate: 2456000 x 4598; that would slow things down. wouldn‚Äôt it?

The simpler way to calculate quickly would be instead of spelling down a whole number. use small numbers paired with an abbreviation for magnitude (or. if necessary. exponents). 1K as opposed to 1000.

When given a huge. excessively exact number. such as 7432. immediately translate it to 7K. Anyhow. you are estimating.

This format for numbers makes multiplication and division quick.

KK is M. [K is Kilo; M is Mega]

G/M is K. [G is Giga]

4K7M = 28G.

Round both of them towards a small multiple of a power of 2 or 10 to work with larger numbers.

2714 ~= 3010 = 3000.
6500/250 ~= 6400/256 ~= 100 * 2^6 / 2^8 ~= 100 / 2^2 = 25.
Where to start Back of the envelope?
List the common use-cases of the system and decide which critical resources they require. You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start. but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?

Varied use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance. serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU. whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM. Since you need to purchase machines that are maxed out on both dimensions. hosting all those services on homogeneous machines would waste CPU and RAM.

Such differences indicate those features should be split to different services. hosted on independent sets of machines.

Real-world case study - Storage Costs borne by Twitter

Source

Problem: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements
Please note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers from Twitter.

Assumptions:

300 million monthly active users.
50% of users use Twitter daily.
Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
10% of tweets contain media.
Data is stored for 5 years.
Estimations:

Query per second (QPS) estimate:

Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000
Let‚Äôs start solving
There are 2 important queries that need to be addressed for any system:

‚ÄúRequests per second‚Äù at the server level
‚ÄúQueries per second‚Äù at the database level.
Let‚Äôs start with ‚Äúrequests per second‚Äù & what inputs are required to estimate its number

Users: Twitter has 300 million active MAUs. Not every user on Twitter is an active post-maker. 50% use daily - 150 million DAU
Usage per DAU: 10-25% make a tweet. Again. this doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; getting within an order of magnitude should be fine. Say each DAU. on average. makes 2 tweets: so 0.25%*2 = 0.5 tweets per DAU.
Scaling factor: Usage rate for a service has peaks & valleys throughout the day. Eg: The usage rate for your favorite e-commerce store or food delivery app will heavily increase in the case of discounts or sales in a particular festive season. We need to estimate how high the traffic would peak compared to the average. This would reflect the request per second peak where the design could potentially break. Most people tweet in the morning. so the tweet creation traffic is twice the average when US east coast wakes up.
Thus. total tweets in a day = 150 M DAU * (0.5 tweets/DAU) * (2x scaling factor in the morning)
Thus. requests per second = n/(number of seconds in a day) = n/86400 ~ 1500 tweets per second.
Let‚Äôs now look at how much storage is required for storing multimedia files for tweets.

150 million daily tweets. Say 10% of these tweets contain pictures of average size 300kB each & 1% of tweets contain videos of about 50MB each.
Let‚Äôs assume that the files are replicated with 3 copies each & atleast stored for 5 years.
Storage required for pictures = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.1 of tweets have images)* 300kB (image size) * 3copies = 13.5TB.
Storage required for videos per day = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.01 of tweets have videos) * (50MB video size) * 3copies ~ 225TB.
Total storage required for multimedia files per day = 238.5TB
Just the text for a tweet can be stored within 160B (i.e. 1280 bits ~ 160 characters per tweet on average)
Storage required for tweets per day = 150 M * (160B tweet size) * 3copies = 72GB
Let‚Äôs calculate overall storage cost for Twitter
Thus. we learnt that. for running Twitter. in the most basic sense. the following requirements must be met:

Assuming no data compression & our simple 3x replication. in the most basic form - 238.5TB blob storage required for storing all the multimedia of tweets that arrive in a day. 72 GB storage in database is required just for storing the basic tweet content.
Twitter was founded in 2006. However. it launched image sharing in 2011 & video sharing in 2013.
Thus. we can assume. that average storage required per day for videos uploaded by a growing user base can be our current estimate multiplied by a normalization factor of 0.6 (considering 15% of user growth on average. every year. since year of founding).
Thus. we have about (225TB video storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (9 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 443.5PB videos stored.
Similarly for image storage we have (13.5TB photo storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (11 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 32.52PB images stored
To store total multimedia for 11 years worth tweets. in the most fault tolerant & redundant manner. we need - 443.5+32.52 ~ 476.02PB (this figure is close to the actual ballpark around 500PB that Twitter has officially shared here)
Twitter uses AWS for storage of tweets & accompanying multimedia files. Say we use intelligent tiering by S3 to pay for data. that is most recent & popularly accessed. Other data. we can archive. & fetch on demand & pay for.
Estimating the media storage cost
476.02PB can be broken down into. say - 300 PB till 2019 (considering that video & images got introduced late) and 276PB after 2017.
Assuming the worst case pricing of S3 (the standard pricing) - All the multimedia of the last 3 years‚Äô tweets can be stored in S3 regular access & the other. can be stored in S3 archives (so we save cost) Thus. as per S3 pricing values. we end up paying:

For 300PB in archive: 308.073.20 USD monthly

For 276PB in regular tier: 5.935.645.70 USD monthly

Every year. our estimate of Twitter. pays 6.243.718.90 USD monthly. to store our images & videos.

Estimating the database cost for our tweets
Let‚Äôs use AWS relational database DynamoDB to store tweet data in a structured form - such as user info. tweet text. number of likes & retweets.
Twitter needs to store 72GB of tweets in a regular relational database. each day. to keep the lights on.
Again. estimating our normalization factor of 0.6 to aggregate tweet data. across 16 years since Twitter supporting text sharing right from the start. we get - (72 GB tweet data per day) *(365 days)* (16 years since tweeting was launched) * 0.6 = 252.28TB
Thus. using a standard on-demand DynamoDB (unoptimized for cost. but great for scale) - the storage cost comes to 603.355.92 USD monthly. to store our data.
For an actual analysis of all the databases Twitter uses. checkout this reference link
Here‚Äôs the actual AWS calculator cost estimation performed for this purpose.

Thus. this most basic. unoptimized design of that we made. pays 82.164.897.81 USD = 82 million USD every year to AWS. to keep providing its storage services only.

We have not even begun to discuss the computing costs. the data science costs in the cloud. Also. to keep this article a light read. we haven‚Äôt taken into consideration scalability solutions such as caching. multi-AZ databases and several aspects of storage itself.

Thus. you might now understand why Elon Musk is bent on optimizing this system a lot & even implementing the ‚ÄúDeep Cuts‚Äù plan to reduce infrastructure costs by a billion. But trying to fire 50% of the workforce and have the rest leave because the ship is sinking still doesn't make sense. To top it off. if your major problem is infrastructure cost you don't fire engineers. you task engineers to reduce infrastructure costs. Now. we may not agree or disagree with this logic. but atleast we‚Äôve learnt how to ballpark the financial element of the same.

Cheat Sheet for Back of the Envelope
We studied a way of estimating the storage cost borne by Twitter. But what about getting the speed of a video-game streaming platform? Or the requests per second of a payment gateway?

Fear not. here are a few important numbers that we can use to estimate useful metrics of any software system & what corresponding technical requirements it must be able to satisfy.

For estimating load in a given time duration
The following numbers are heavily rounded and help determine how often something needs to happen over a period of time. For example. if a server has a million requests per day. it will need to handle 12 requests per second.

Use the table below to convert requests handled by server across different durations of time

For estimating speed/latency of the system
These 14 latency numbers. revealed by Dr. Dean (Google). form the foundation of systems designing & performance optimization. Using these numbers we can predict how long it would take for a system to perform its computations. Refer to this website and the image below as a simple lookup for these numbers

What do we understand from this

Memory is fast. but the disk is slow.
Avoid disk seeks if possible.
Simple compression algorithms are fast.
Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible.
Data centers are usually in different regions. and it takes time to send data between them.
In a nutshell
A lot of back of the envelope calculations are done with just coefficients and exponents. e.g.. c‚àó10e. Your goal is to get within an order of magnitude right that‚Äôs just e. c matters a lot less.

What did we learn

Back of the envelope calculations allow you to take a look at different variations.
When designing your system. these are the kind of calculations you should do over and over in your head.
Know the back of the envelope numbers for the building blocks of your system. It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers. you have to know how your subsystems perform. You can't make decent back of the envelope calculations if you don't know what's happening.
Monitor and measure every part of your system so you can make these sorts of projections from real data.
I hope you understood how systems are operated in terms of estimating engineering infrastructure requirements. provisions & costing. What‚Äôs the one system that you want me to target next for back of the envelope analysis?

üí°
Tensor is a number/collection of numbers that maintains its meaning under transformations
üí°
More complex. but correct definition - An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules.
Each index of a tensor ranges over the number of dimensions of space. However. the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta).

Tensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices). vectors (that have exactly one index). and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.
Tensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity. fluid mechanics. and general relativity.
Beginner-friendly
Clearing the meaning. usage and confusions about tensors in ML and math
Tensors. a crucial concept in the field of machine learning. deep learning. and data science. often become a stumbling block for many learners. To fully grasp the idea. we'll break it down. explore examples. and demystify various related aspects such as rank. dimension. components. indices. size. and shape.

What are Tensors?
In simple terms. tensors are a generalization of scalars. vectors. and matrices. They can be seen as multidimensional arrays of numbers. with each dimension known as a rank.

A scalar is a single number. a tensor of rank 0.
A vector is an array of numbers. a tensor of rank 1.
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. a tensor of rank 2.
A 3D array. or a "cube" of numbers. is a tensor of rank 3.
The ranks continue to increase to define higher dimensional spaces.

Breaking Down the Definition of a Tensor
The formal definition of a tensor. "An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules." often overwhelms beginners. So. let's simplify it:

"nth-rank tensor": Rank refers to the number of dimensions or indices the tensor has. For example. a rank 1 tensor is a vector (which has one dimension). a rank 2 tensor is a matrix (which has two dimensions). and so on.
"m-dimensional space": This refers to the size of each dimension. For a matrix (rank 2 tensor). this would be the number of rows and columns.
"m^n components": Components are the individual elements or data points that make up the tensor. For example. in a matrix. each number is a component.
Simplifying with Examples
Consider a 3x3 image with three color channels (Red. Green. Blue). It is represented as a 3D array or a rank 3 tensor. with dimensions of 3 (height) x 3 (width) x 3 (color channels). It would have 3^3 or 27 components (individual color values for pixels).

Delving Deeper: Case of a 4x4 Image
Let's take a more specific example: a 4x4 pixel image with three color channels. Here. the tensor would have a rank of 3 (height. width. and color channels). The dimensions would be 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels). and there would be 4^3 or 64 components.

The indices here refer to the position of each component within the tensor. For example. you might reference the red color value of the pixel in the second row and third column as [2.3.1]. where '2' refers to the row. '3' refers to the column. and '1' refers to the red channel.

The size of this tensor would be calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions together. resulting in 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels) = 48. The shape of this tensor would be (4. 4. 3). describing the number of elements along each dimension.

Difference Between Rank and Dimension
While both terms describe the structure of a tensor. they represent different aspects. The rank is the number of dimensions. while the dimensions refer to the size (or length) of each of those dimensions. In the case of our 4x4 pixel image tensor. the rank is 3. and the dimensions are 4. 4. and 3.

Sample Log of a 4x4x3 Tensor
A 4x4 pixel image with three color channels can be represented as a 3D array (or rank 3 tensor). Each pixel's color is represented by a 3-element vector (for the three color channels). and the image consists of a 4x4 grid of such pixels. giving us a shape of (4. 4. 3).

A 4x4 pixel image with 3 color channels could be represented as a 4x4x3 tensor. like this:


tensor = [
    [  # First row of pixels
        [230. 10. 10].    # Red-ish
        [230. 230. 10].  # Yellow-ish
        [10. 230. 10].   # Green-ish
        [10. 230. 230]   # Cyan-ish
    ].
    [  # Second row of pixels
        [10. 10. 230].   # Blue-ish
        [230. 10. 230].  # Magenta-ish
        [220. 220. 220]. # Light gray
        [120. 120. 120]  # Gray
    ].
    [  # Third row of pixels
        [30. 30. 30].    # Dark gray
        [230. 50. 10].   # Different shade of red
        [230. 230. 60].  # Different shade of yellow
        [10. 60. 230]    # Different shade of blue
    ].
    [  # Fourth row of pixels
        [40. 230. 40].   # Different shade of green
        [50. 10. 230].   # Another shade of blue
        [230. 40. 230].  # Another shade of magenta
        [10. 40. 10]     # Dark green
    ]
]



Clearing the Confusion Around "Dimension"
The term "dimension" can lead to some confusion. In the context of tensors. "dimension" often refers to the depth of nested lists. not the geometric or mathematical space that a vector might represent. So. a vector like [3. 4] is a rank-1 tensor (or one-dimensional array) because it involves no nesting of lists. Its shape is considered to be (2.) because it contains two elements.

In summary. tensors. while initially appearing complex. can be demystified and understood through the step-by-step breakdown of their components and properties. As multidimensional arrays. they provide the foundation for manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning. making them a fundamental concept for anyone delving into these fields.

Advanced
Exploring more properties of tensors
Understanding Covariance & Contravariance
A vector can be expressed in terms of its contravariant or covariant components

CASE 1: Expressing in terms of contravariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of components with basis vectors

üí°
We need 1 index for each of the components as there is only 1 directional indicator per component. 1 index. 1 basis vector. per component
If we decrease the length of the ‚Äúbasic vectors‚Äù (in a vector space). then the number of components required to make up a vector increases. Because the index & the number of components change contrary to each other. they are known as contravariant components of a vector Describing a vector in terms of these contravariant components (eg : 2 i + 3 j + 4 k) is how we usually describe a vectors


CASE 2: Expressing in terms of covariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of dot-product with basis vectorsIf we decrease the length of the basis vectors. then the dot-product decreases & vice versa. Since these properties are varying in the same way. we say that these are covariant components of a vector.


Specifying the notation for covariant & contravariant components


Now. say we take 2 vectors V & P

üí°
Index (for this rank 2 tensor. i.e. a vector) = unique combination of basis vectors
CASE 1: We multiply the contravariant values of V & P. On considering all possible ways. we get a matrix:

This will give us a tensor of rank 2 with 2 contra-variant index values. Here. each T value is called an element of this tensor. And since for each element. 2 indices (2 directional indicators are required) eg: Understanding by example. say we have a combination of 3 area vectors & 3 force vectors. To get the combination of all the forces on all the area vectors. for each such combination. we require 2 indices (i.e. 2 directional indicators ‚Üí 1 for the force & 1 for the area). We get 9 components. each with 2 indices (referring to 2 basis vectors)

What makes a tensor a tensor. is that. when the basis vectors change. the components of the tensor would change in the same manner as they would in one of these objects ‚Üí thus keeping the overall combination the same

What is it about the combination of components & basis vectors that makes tensors so powerful ‚Üí all observers in all reference frames agree. not on the components or the basis vectors ‚Üí but on their combinations. because they are the same

Index & Rank of tensors
üí°
Rank = the total number of indices = total number of coordinate systems (we need to have knowledge of to understand the location of the tensor) = total number of unique basis vector combinations = total number of unique linearly independent combinations = The total number of contravariant and covariant indices of a tensor.

The rank R of a tensor is independent of the number of dimensions N of the underlying space.
A tensor does not necessarily have to be created from vector components as is shown in these examples

A tensor of rank 1 is a ‚Äúvector‚Äù and has a number associated with each of the basis vectors. Only 1 index i.e. 1 combo of basis vectors is required to know the location


Here. \($V^1 = 5. V^2 = 3. V^3 = 2$\)


A tensor of rank 2 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 2 basis vectors


In a tensor of rank 3 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 3 basis vectors - composed of the components of 3 basis vectors. We can create different descriptions of this tensor by using different contravariant & covariant components of the basis vectors




More mathematical facts
While the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors. the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry. intended to represent physical space) . and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.
Objects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars. those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors. and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation. a vector v would be written $v_i$. where i=1. .... m. and matrix is a tensor of type (1.1). which would be written $a_i^j$ in tensor notation.
Tensors may be operated on by other tensors (such as metric tensors. the permutation tensor. or the Kronecker delta) or by tensor operators (such as the covariant derivative). The manipulation of tensor indices to produce identities or to simplify expressions is known as index gymnastics. which includes index lowering and index raising as special cases. These can be achieved through multiplication by a so-called metric tensor $g_{ij}. g^{ij}. g_i^j$. etc.. e.g..
Tensor notation can provide a very concise way of writing vector and more general identities. For example. in tensor notation. the dot product u¬∑v is simply written u¬∑v = $u_iv^i$ If two tensors A and B have the same rank and the same covariant and contravariant indices. then they can be added in the obvious way.
The generalization of the dot product applied to tensors is called tensor contraction. and consists of setting two unlike indices equal to each other and then summing using the Einstein summation convention. Various types of derivatives can be taken of tensors. the most common being the comma derivative and covariant derivative.
If the components of any tensor of any tensor rank vanish in one particular coordinate system. they vanish in all coordinate systems. A transformation of the variables of a tensor changes the tensor into another whose components are linear homogeneous functions of the components of the original tensor.
Tensors in the context of machine learning
The property of tensors to maintains its meaning under transformations is used also by machine learning. where real world data is transformed into corresponding tensors & then heavy calculations are done on these tensors to get valuable insights.

I used to just get so confused for understanding how do I actually incorporate a culture of powerful customer obsession that big companies like Amazon. Airbnb. Stripe speak so strongly about.

What does it mean? How does that change your workflow? What small optimizations can you do that can ensure you become such a company?

Yeah. you don't need a dedicated team for that - I want to list simple things you can do as a solopreneur in a garage as well.

Here's 4 learnings that I've had. from my current and previous startup. on how to build a reflex muscle for customer obsession. from 120+ overall interviews I've done.

0] an intro to the topic
Customer-centricity means you just know so much about the customer. that when you take decisions about product. you can tell exactly how your customers will react to it.

It's important because it builds very great relationship with them and they will stand by your team and product even when things don't work out that well.

1] 5hrs of talktime per week
If you're having less than 5hrs of talktime with customers. that means you either know everything about them or you need to find a different set of people to talk to. who're willing to spend time to discuss the problem.

Easy ways to get this:

Start by just asking your friends for people in their companies or families for a call and ask them to connect further. If you don't know anyone. just cold reachout your competitors' customers on Linkedin
Just ask for 25min calls. They seem shorter than 30 for some reason so I've seen people say yes and then give you the extra 5.
Ask them to not refer to "anyone". but "1 name" that they can think of - this is fast. and has 100% success rate.
Setup a communication channel on a platform they're most comfortable on. (Whatsapp. Telegram. Discord etc.) where you can just keep talking to them as friends
2] Less than a day of turnaround time
When you're a young company. you can provide near instanteneous customer support and that goes a long way in turning early adopters into evangelists. This is simple - just have them as priority notifications and swear you will reply something the moment you see a popup. Direct lines with founders who ping back quick feel very nice.

3] Organizing their feedback
This is the most important part. I'm sharing my company's template for this. It's just colorful stickies you can move around. but captures certain key snippets across multiple customers really well.

Just pick key sentences they say. tag and color them well - really helps a lot. Here's an example


At our company Recontact. we're helping people be amazing at building long-term relationships in professional and personal settings

Using this strategy. we figured out (check video) that "Maintenance" (i.e. keeping in touch with people) - was the most talked about point in our problem statement - because it had more stickies. And that realization saved us from spending 2 weeks worth of time in making "Search" in our app more efficient - because that's not what our customers cared about.

So yeah. that coloring and legend-making you did as a kid - well that's one of the key components in making a customer-centric business.

4] Building a muscle for the info
Revise. revise. revise. This. I learned from Apple CEO Tim Cook - who starts his day with reading random customer emails. Well. you can always read these stickies. Look into a simple analytics dashboard you can create for your app. - template link

You won't see it instantly. but. over time. a decision-making muscle gets built (very much like driving. music. fashion-sense) - that is very grounded in qualitative and quantitative analysis of customer feedback.

Listen to even the smallest details - you might not remember instantly. but then you'll be surprised how often you'll randomly remember a customer fact. when making a decision related to it.

In closing
You can be crazy passionate about this too - write customer snippets on your wall. listen to customer interviews at the gym. be thoughtful with delighting gifts. send personalized notes when their kids graduate etc. etc. etc.

Bottom line - Be close to the customer. even though the product will not work out. your company will. Business runs on trust and mutual respect.

"Social Capital" is simply the "network of relationships and acquantainces" that a person has developed over life".

We all hear fancy ass quotes about "making strong professional relations". "staying in touch with friends" and "your network is your net-worth". Here's a quick rundown of the best-selling way to build such social capital. since the past 80 years and beyond! Basically. become more likeable.

These are my key pointers from the book "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie. Each topic is its own tweetstorm - so kick back and read these wisdom snippets to help you build a strong people network.

With that let's dive in by understanding 6 ways to be a person who's good at making friends.

6 ways to make people like you
üí°
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
A dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love

You can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can. in 2 years. by trying to get other people interested in you

When you see a group photograph that you're in. whose picture do you look for first ?

It is the individual who is not interested in his/her fellow men/women who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring

You have to be interested in people if you wanna be a successful writer of stories

Can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them

eg : To call someone for an interview. write a letter first enclosing a list of questions that you except them to answer about themselves and their method of work

To find out someone's birthday ‚áí Begin by asking whether he/she believes the date of anyone's birth has anything to do with character or disposition

A show of interest. like every other human emotion. must be sincere

üí°
2. Smile
A smile says - "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you". That is why dogs make such a hit

A real smile. a heartwarming smile. a smile that comes from within. the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace

People who smile. tend to manage. teach and sell more effectively

Smile comes through in your voice

Hard work alone is the magic ¬†key that will unlock the door to our desires. People have succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. As the fun becomes work. people change ‚áí lose joy in it. leading business to grow dull and fail

Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Different mental attitude

Action seems to follow feeling but really. action and feeling go together and by regulating the action. which is under the more direct control of the will. we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not

Thus. the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there

Most folks are about as happy as they make up our minds to be

Picture in your mind. the able. earnest. useful person you desire to be and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual

A man/woman without a smiling face must not open a shop. It costs nothing but creates much

üí°
3. A person's name is to that person. the sweetest and most important sound in any language
The average person is more interested in his or her own name in all the other names on earth put together
Remember that name and call it easily. and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage
The executive who can't remember names can't remember a significant part of his/ her business and is operating on quicksand
Take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds
Most important ways of gaining good will is by remembering names and making people feel important
To recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion
To repeat the name several times during conversation and try to associate it with the person's features. expression and general appearance
Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices
Magic contained in a name should be realized as the single item. wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else.
The name sets the individual apart; it makes him/ her unique among all others
The info we are imparting or the request we are making takes on special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.
From the waitress to the senior executive herself. the name will work magic as we deal with others.
üí°
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention
Dale Carnegie on listening and responding ‚áí Hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise
Good conversationalists are merely good listeners who encourage a person to talk
"Yes. and" - pay attention and show indications of it from time to time with approval or disapproval.
Important personages crave a good listener but ordinary folk do too.
"Many a person call a doctor when all they want is an audience"
If you wanna know how to PREVENT making people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you. here is the recipe :
Always listen to anyone for long
Don't talk incessantly about yourself
If you have an idea while the other person is talking. wait for him/ her to finish
People who talk of themselves think only of themselves
Those people who think of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. no matter how instructed they may be
People you might be talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems
Therefore. if you aspire to be a good conversationalist. be an attentive listener
üí°
5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests
Theodore Roosevelt used to sit up late the night before. reading up on the subject in which he knew the guest is particularly interested in
Road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he/ she treasures most
The reward is an enlargement of life each time you speak to someone
üí°
6. Make the other person feel important ‚Äî and do it sincerely
If we are contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get somethin out of the other person in return ‚Äî we shall meet with the failure that we so richly deserve
Attain the feeling that you have done something for him/ her without his/ her being able to do anything in return for you
The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated ~ William James
Do unto others and you would have others do unto you
Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you". "Would you be so kind as to ‚Äî?". "Won't you please ?". "Would you mind". "Thank you ‚Äî" little courtesies like these. oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday and. incidentally. they are the hallmark of good breeding
The power of honest appreciation is stupendous as everyone considers themselves imp
Every person I meet is my superior in some way ¬†~Emerson
Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
In conclusion
Be interested. smile. remember their name. listen more. talk about their interests and make them feel important. You nail that and you find yourself as a likeable. good friend who is connected to a lot of different kinds of people very well.

This is going to be a super fast guide for developers to leverage platform development tools with VR and build cool apps. Starting with just a laptop and a Meta Quest in your hand.

Here's what the final thing looks like:


Code
Here's the GitHub Repo containing all the code - https://github.com/CMU-SV-Ronith/sem_3pi

Introduction to VR and AI-Generated NPCs
Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we interact with digital environments. offering immersive experiences that blur the lines between the virtual and real world. One of the most exciting advancements in VR is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). especially in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with users in more human-like ways. This blog post delves into the creation of an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. highlighting the technological synergy of VR and AI.

Choosing the Right Engine
When embarking on VR app development. selecting the right engine is crucial. Two prominent engines are Unity and Unreal. After extensive research and testing. Unity emerged as the preferable choice for several reasons:

Ease of Learning and Accessibility: Unity uses C#. known for its simpler syntax and automatic memory management. This choice makes Unity accessible. especially for beginners and indie developers. unlike Unreal Engine's complex C++.
Asset Store and Community Support: Unity boasts an expansive Asset Store. providing numerous resources that speed up development. Coupled with an active community. developers have access to extensive support and shared knowledge.
Versatility in 2D and 3D Development: Unity's proficiency in both 2D and 3D development offers flexibility. allowing developers to work on various project types without switching engines.
Platform Support and Integration: Unity's broad platform support. including PCs. consoles. mobile devices. and VR systems. is vital for developers targeting diverse audiences.
Strong Documentation and Educational Resources: Unity‚Äôs comprehensive documentation and learning resources are invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.
Making API Calls in C# with Code-Walkthrough
We code in C# in Unity. Here's a simple video on integrating Unity App with C# code that you write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgUIx75fJ_E

This was used for the Speech Analysis and Text Analysis functions.

To integrate AI into our VR app. we need to make API calls. This is achieved through UnityEngine.Networking. setting up coroutines for HTTP(s) communications. The process involves getting and posting information. waiting for responses. and updating the UI to reflect changes. We utilize AWS for backend services and the Dolby Media Speech Analytics API for speech analysis.

The AnalyzeText coroutine sends a user's transcript to our backend for processing. while GetAnalysisResults retrieves the analysis. The AnalyseSpeech coroutine sends audio files for speech analysis. and UploadFileToS3 handles the uploading of files to AWS S3.

API connectors in the app
private IEnumerator AnalyzeText(string transcript)
        {
            var requestJson = new
            {
                prompt = transcript
            };

            var request = new UnityWebRequest(baseUrl + "/analyzeText". "POST")

            if (transcriptionTask.Exception != null)
            {
                Debug.LogError("Transcription failed: " + transcriptionTask.Exception);
                yield break;
            }

            var res = transcriptionTask.Result;
            StartCoroutine(AnalyzeText(res.Text));
        }
Creating NPCs with Inworld.ai and Trigger Words
NPCs are given life using tools like Inworld.ai. which allows for the creation of characters with specific goals and triggers. For instance. an NPC can be programmed to give a task when a user says a particular phrase. This adds an interactive layer to the VR experience. making it more engaging and realistic.

The code snippet for NPC interaction demonstrates how to set up these interactions. It includes setting up goals. defining trigger phrases. and programming responses and actions based on user interaction.

Complete Code and Overall Walkthrough
The complete code combines all these elements into a cohesive VR app. It demonstrates the integration of various APIs. handling of voice and text inputs. and interaction with NPCs. The code is structured to ensure seamless interaction within the VR environment. enabling users to experience a realistic and interactive AI interview.

This guide offers a window into the intricate process of developing an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. By combining Unity's versatile development environment with powerful APIs and AI-driven NPCs. developers can create engaging and immersive VR experiences. The future of VR and AI in app development is undoubtedly bright. offering endless possibilities for innovation and user engagement.

This article is a refresher to anyone looking to build in sales - the current approach. terminology. key insights. challenges and opportunities available in this domain.


What is a sales funnel?
A sales funnel is the marketing term for the journey potential customers go through on the way to purchase. There are several steps to a sales funnel. usually known as the top. middle. and bottom of the funnel. although these steps may vary depending on a company's sales model.

A basic sales funnel can be described as consisting of 4 levels. Marketers can take inspiration from this basic structure to design a sales funnel that suits the needs of their organisation.

Awareness: At the very top of the sales funnel is the awareness stage that is populated by the largest number of people. These people. not quite ready to be prospects yet. have just had their first interactions with your company and its offerings. They don‚Äôt know much about your brand at this stage. but are aware that it exists.
Interest: The first interactions will hook some of these newly-aware people and draw them slightly deeper into the funnel. With their interest piqued. these people will spend some time getting to know more about your company and your offerings. They might browse your website or catalogue. read your blogs. or peruse reviews from past customers.
Consideration: Armed with knowledge gathered during the interest stage. your prospects will double down on their efforts to know your company and offerings better. They may reach out to your customer service team with specific questions. or fill out a form to access more information. Remember. by this stage they may have already compared your offerings to those of your competitors. So. it is important to clearly answer their questions and help them understand how your offerings can solve their problems or needs.
Negotiation and decision: The prospect has now almost decided to purchase your product or service. Depending on the nature of your offerings. they might begin a negotiation over the price. terms of purchase. or both. But it‚Äôs fair to assume that they have a purchase intention at this stage.
At the end of this stage ‚Äîthe prospect and seller have negotiated the terms of the sale to their mutual satisfaction. and the prospect pays the seller to officially become a buyer.
Extra - Renewal or repurchase: The sale stage is not the end of the sales funnel. Soon a time will come when the sales contract is up for renewal. The customer must now decide if they want to continue with the same seller. If so. there might be a fresh round of negotiations over price and purchase terms. followed by a renewal or repurchase.

Here's an image of the currently most widely used Sales tools and the stage of the funnel they're utilized in:


Why is a sales funnel imp?
That‚Äôs the value of knowing a sales funnel: Successful sellers understand the journey a prospect is likely to take before they buy. and can make sure they‚Äôre ready to move on to each stage. They‚Äôre focused on the buyer. meeting their needs in the moment and building trust that helps move the deal forward.

So what if you ditched the sales funnel? You‚Äôd run the risk of focusing too much on the close to hit quota. pushing products or services when prospects aren‚Äôt ready. Win rates would drop because prospects wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the solutions they‚Äôre offered. and trust would be lost. No long-term relationships. no cross-sells. or upsells.

What challenges does sales have in 2023?
Challenge 1: Standing Out From the Competition
To differentiate from others. salespeople should exceed prospects' expectations by being well-versed in their CRM and sales software. and staying updated with industry trends and news.
Today. SaaS companies offer personalised email marketing. educational content. and in-depth exploratory calls with experienced representatives. Therefore. if you want to stand out from the crowd. you must be one step ahead of the already high standards of helpful. inbound selling.
Gather sales enablement materials like industry specific demos. case studies. reviews. testimonials. and analytics tools or reports.
Keep up with industry news. trends. and reports to help prospects guide strategy and show the potential ROI to their supervisors or other decision makers.
Set up alerts and automation to help you follow up with prospects at the right time and provide valuable resources.
Existing tools - Apollo.io. Outreach.io
Opportunity: This presents an opportunity to innovate in personalized and inbound selling.
Challenge 2: Meeting Quotas
A sales representative's best strategy for achieving quotas and converting leads is to make phone calls - whether they are selling remotely or not.
2. Two thirds of salespeople also use discounts and promotions. and more than half report that they increase sales. The most popular promotion among sellers is bundling a suite of products. followed by free trials.

Challenge 3: Getting in Direct Contact with Decision-Makers
With remote work becoming prevalent. establishing a strong social media presence. particularly on LinkedIn. is crucial for connecting with decision-makers.
In 2023. 67% of sales representatives worked under a hybrid or fully remote basis. and globally. almost 70% of professionals worked remotely. Many leaders and decision makers have physically moved to new locations farther away from their headquarters as industry events have largely shifted to virtual and hybrid formats.
It's crucial that salespeople establish their own presence on social media if they haven't already done so. LinkedIn was rated as the most effective platform for prospect research by nearly three quarters of sales professionals.
Challenge 4: Lack of High-Quality Leads
The first place to look when dealing with lead quality issues is sales and marketing alignment. Having a shared understanding of the ideal customer profile or buyer persona for sales and marketing teams is essential.
Assess the lifetime value of customers and which ones turn into promoters in order to develop and update these assets.
Using tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. HubSpot Sales Hub. LeadIQ. and others. sales teams find and engage with prospects at the right time after identifying target customers.
Challenge 5: Keeping Prospects Engaged Throughout the Sales Process
It is important to understand your buyer in terms of the bigger picture context so you can keep their interest throughout the sales process. which can be lengthy depending on the software package or service you are selling.
It is common for sales representatives to communicate with prospects two to seven times during B2B and B2C sales processes. which adds up when considering that most work with dozens of prospects at once.
The use of automated sales management tools and CRMs with lead intelligence and logging of communications with prospects (such as phone calls. emails. and actions) can help sales teams manage hundreds of data points to successfully acquire new customers.
Challenge 6: Difficulty Getting Meetings With Prospects
Timing is everything. Reach out at the wrong time. you‚Äôre a nuisance. Reach out at the right time. and you‚Äôre the answer to a prayer. It‚Äôs well known in the industry that the best salespeople spend most of their time on calls with prospects listening.
In order to secure meetings with qualified prospects. the best strategy is to listen. And to make it easy to meet with you. When listening for signals that a prospect is ready to meet. use these questions as a guide:
Social selling requires a combination of social media savvy and sales tools that can automatically flag key readiness indicators and send automatic alerts.
Key insights from 30+ interviews with sales and growth teams
Over the past 3 weeks. with conversations over 30 sales people. here are the key insights that stood out from my learnings in the current approach:

Efficiency in Data Management: Many use tools like Excel and Salesforce for data organization. but there's a challenge in maintaining data hygiene and integrating personal notes effectively.
Personalized Customer Engagement: Sales reps emphasize personalized interactions. like remembering personal details about clients and customizing outreach. This includes tactics like social media engagement. client lunches. and gift-giving.
Utilization of Digital Tools: Sales teams heavily rely on digital tools like CRM systems. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. and calendar reminders for tracking client interactions and industry news.
Challenges with Remote and Hybrid Sales: Adapting to remote and hybrid sales environments is a notable challenge. affecting how sales reps connect with decision-makers and clients.
Importance of Relationship Building: There's a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships. seen as crucial in high-value sales.
Adapting to Market and Client Dynamics: Sales reps must adapt to changing client personnel and market conditions.
Efficient Use of Time and Resources: Balancing time spent on tasks like data entry and client engagement is crucial. especially in cold outreach and event networking.
Conclusion
In summary. the sales funnel remains a vital concept in the sales process. guiding potential customers from awareness to purchase.

In 2023. sales teams face challenges like standing out from the competition. meeting quotas. and effectively engaging with decision-makers. particularly in remote and hybrid work environments.

Utilizing digital tools like CRMs and LinkedIn. focusing on personalized customer engagement. and maintaining efficient data management are essential strategies. Building strong relationships and adapting to market dynamics are key to navigating these challenges.

Sales teams must balance innovative selling techniques with the efficient use of time and resources to succeed in the evolving sales landscape.

This blog is from notes from an amazing talk at the OpenAI DevDay conference by Colin Jarvis and John Allard. Here's the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y)
In the realm of natural language processing. optimizing large language models (LLMs) is a formidable challenge. Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity. The performance of LLMs. often abstract and difficult to measure. requires a nuanced approach to optimization. In this blog. we‚Äôll explore a mental model of options for LLM optimization and develop an appreciation for which option to use and when.

You will leave with a foundational understanding of the two axes of optimization‚Äîcontext and LLM behavior‚Äîas well as a practical guide to the nuanced world of model refinement.

The Twin Axes of Optimization

1. Context Optimization
At its core. context optimization is about fine-tuning what the model needs to know. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:

Prompt Engineering: As the lower-left quadrant in our optimization matrix. prompt engineering is your fast lane to setting a baseline. Start by refining the prompts you feed into the LLM and observe the performance changes.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Positioned in the upper-left. RAG introduces more context. Begin with simple retrieval mechanisms. and consider fine-tuning for a more nuanced approach.
2. LLM Behavior Optimization
LLM behavior optimization delves into how the model should act. The two main strategies are:

Fine-tuning: The lower-right quadrant represents fine-tuning. which customizes the LLM‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks.
Comprehensive Approach: Sometimes. a combination of all methods is required to reach the desired performance level. An example would be integrating HyDE retrieval with a fact-checking step.
The key is to start somewhere. evaluate. and then iterate with another method.

Strategies Explored
Prompt Engineering: The Starting Block
Starting with clear. concise instructions and breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks is paramount. Giving models "time to think" and testing changes systematically can yield surprising improvements. Extending this by providing reference text and using external tools can further enhance the results.


When It Shines:

Quick testing and learning
Establishing a baseline for further optimization
Its Limitations:

Introducing new information
Replicating complex styles or methodologies

Retrieval Augmented Generation: Expanding Knowledge
By giving LLMs access to domain-specific content. RAG helps update the model's knowledge and control the content it generates to reduce inaccuracies.


When It Shines:

Introducing new. specific information
Controlling content to reduce errors
Its Limitations:

Broad domain understanding
Learning new languages. formats. or styles
Enhancing RAG:

Employ retrieval with cosine similarity and HyDE
Experiment with FT embeddings and chunking
Implement reranking and classification steps
Evaluating RAG:

On the LLM side. consider the faithfulness and relevance of the answers.
On the content side. assess the precision and recall of the context retrieved. More data does not necessarily equate to higher accuracy.

Fine-tuning: The Custom Tailor
When prompt engineering doesn't cut it. fine-tuning may be the right path. Continuing the training process with domain-specific data can optimize model performance and efficiency. For example. Canva leveraged fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to produce structured output. showcasing the power of high-quality training data.


When It Shines:

Emphasizing existing knowledge
Customizing response structure or tone
Its Limitations:

Injecting new knowledge into the model
Quick iterations on new use-cases
Steps to Fine-tune:

Data preparation
Hyperparameter selection and loss function understanding during training
Evaluation with relevant test sets and expert opinion
Fine-tuning Best Practices:

Start with prompt engineering
Establish a clear baseline
Prioritize quality over quantity in training data

The Combined Approach: Fine-tuning + RAG
Sometimes. a blend of fine-tuning and RAG yields the best results. This method allows the model to understand complex instructions with minimal tokens. creating more space for retrieved context and leading to a more robust performance.




Practical Application
The real-world application of these strategies can be as creative as generating hypothetical answers to enhance similarity searches. For example. initial baselines might yield a 69% performance rate. while a RAG with a well-crafted answer could increase that to 84%. comparable to fine-tuning. Collaborations. such as the one between Scale AI and OpenAI. demonstrate how a combined approach can optimize models to new heights of efficiency and effectiveness.


Careful what you fine-tune on
In conclusion. maximizing LLM performance isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It requires a toolkit of strategies‚Äîfrom prompt engineering to fine-tuning and beyond‚Äîeach with its own set of benefits and best-use scenarios.

there needs to be a part of education that allows students to dream and tinker and take risks. Something that makes them laugh and cry and hope and bond and stay up late in teams and chase self-assigned deadlines and ship something they would have never thought they could.

that was the ideal of buildschool.

we wanted to give students "an ecosystem of believer-builders who built things to solve problems because they wanted to". and having friends around always helps.

but the issue was. we were targeting a student base who had just come back from remote learning. who was not entirely immersed into this tinkering culture and was more driven by definite career paths.

in April 2022. Technical Society (TechSoc) started with minimal funding. full motivation and targeted growth hacks. to grow a strong community. I think the best takebacks from this journey are perseverence. dealing with ambiguity. and faith in the dreamers of tomorrow.

and our approach at TechSoc has always been - invest in the team. invest in the participants and invest in the future. here's 3 stages of how we built a community from scratch and run it well. to this day.

üí°
This journey was only possible due to the amazing contribution by Anouksha Hemanth. Prabhat Bedida. Subham Sagar. Yashaswi. Piyush Agrawal. Nikshay Jain. Vishwajeet. GK Harish and several others who made this vision real.¬†
building a team
first. we had to make team buildschool believe that the mission they were solving was important because they would be enablers of a movement much bigger than themselves. so Anouksha and me used YCombinator's startup school curriculum and actually had each manager at buildschool study startup from a perspective of product strategy. history. revenue and future steps. this helped them understand how products are built. gain confidence in talking more about these ideas and also be better thinkers in general. over 2.5 months we did multiple startup teardowns. had these people practice cold emailing founders and speaking comfortably with them. here are some of their early day case studies.

once our little army was ready. it was time to go to war. boy. was it going to be brutal.

inspiring a community
the early days were very random and we had barely any clue of processes and contacts and pretty much anything. we were just very clear on what we had to solve - get 10 student prototypes. not powerpoints. out by the next 13 weeks.

to begin with. the issue was. how do you even get people to care to solve problems? it was always cooler to do fancy PoRs that add sure-shot resume points as opposed to taking a bet on whether you and your buddies could build something or not

and even if people do care. how do you get them to actually learn this process of product building - right from design. to shipping to release to iteration and beyond? well. the answer actually lies in inspiring people.

as Simon Sinek says. if you connect with the "why" of people. you can truly move them to do unbelievable things. and we did all sorts of crazy things to get the message across. here's a video from the early days. just a whiteboard. an ai generated thumbnail and some students talking about a crazy vision of 10 teams. 10 weeks. 10 prototypes.


we did speak to people and touch upon a nerve.

to further this. we revived the history of the "fun in building" through our alumnus Kedar Kulkarni - who started off with very realistic stories of moving up the quality ladder by building computer vision fun-tools with his friends and then moving up to govt partnerships and funded projects. looking back. i think that may have struck a really strong chord - even in me.


something to remind students of where the foundation of innovation lies
sustaining the experience
10 teams selected. basic application on their plan for 10 weeks. we were just looking for grit.

to refine our teams. buildschool organized really amazing talks right from product research and UI designing. all the way up to engineering and growth post launch. we got CXOs and industry veterans to give talks for free - how did we do that? well. we just connected with the "why" of these disruptors through a cold email as simple as:


the thing that sold best was the thought of inspiring students to build more
boom! 7 high quality lectures in various domains - all conducted at zero cost. well. except for the food. it does not have to be complex - ¬†

growth hack - give people free food and they show up the 1st time. give them a memorable experience and they will keep showing up again and again.


give them pizza and they'll do amazing things
and it was hard. students want to do all sorts of things at all times. so we used accountability partners called "build buds" for each team to navigate through getting the right resources. connected to the right folks. and even actually finishing right before deadlines.

guess what - at a mini demo day amongst the teams - 9 of them had a functioning product! here's a random picture from the mini demo day at the 8 week mark.

investing in the future
by the time the 10th week ended. teams had transformed beyond what we had thought. people who didn't know coding had built apps. people who were shy on stage were presenting. people who were unsure about their passions had picked up something new and built something meaningful out of it. well. and the buildschool team - they had gone through the extreme rollercoaster of 0 attendee events (that really happened. it was really stressful) to having a great turnout of 9 products built in those 10 weeks and then we came for a repeat in the upcoming semesters with even more student interest. what makes me smile the most. is that people actually now think of this as a thing they can do full time.


end of buildsprint #1. november 2022
fun fact. one team even got incubated in the startup accelerator at IIT Madras. i look forward to more such stories.

‚≠êÔ∏è here's my takeaway - atleast once in life. i feel. every person must go through the pain and the fulfilment of building something from 0 to 1. because once you're on the other side of the storm - you gain the self-confidence to do anything you want.

that's what our vision at techsoc always has been. cheers and happy building!

Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart is a fantastic tool to deploy machine learning models. In this blog. we'll walk you through the process of using Jumpstart to deploy a model named "Llama2" and expose it as an API endpoint using AWS Lambda functions.

Step 1: Set Up SageMaker Domain and User
Begin by navigating to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Console. Here. create a domain and user profile. This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.

Step 2a: Deploy the Llama2 Model
After setting up your domain and user. head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the "Sagemaker Jumpstart" section. and from there. choose to deploy the "llama 7b model." This process usually takes about seven minutes. and at the end of it. you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this. as it will be essential for the next steps.

Step 2b: Integrating any Huggingface Model with Amazon Sagemaker
Instead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options. you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how

1. Setup development environment
We are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.

import sagemaker
import boto3
sess = sagemaker.Session()
# sagemaker session bucket -> used for uploading data. models and logs
# sagemaker will automatically create this bucket if it not exists
sagemaker_session_bucket=None
if sagemaker_session_bucket is None and sess is not None:
    # set to default bucket if a bucket name is not given
    sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()

    
    
def setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=None):
    """
    Params:
    - default_bucket: Default bucket name to use for the session

    Returns:
    - session: SageMaker session object
    - role_arn: ARN of the IAM execution role
    """
    global sagemaker_execution_role
    session = sagemaker.Session(default_bucket=default_bucket)

    try:
        sagemaker_execution_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
    except ValueError:
        iam = boto3.client('iam')
        sagemaker_execution_role = iam.get_role(RoleName="sagemaker_execution_role")['Role']['Arn']

    return session. sagemaker_execution_role

def mask_account_id(account_id):
    return '*' * len(account_id)

def main():
    sagemaker_session_bucket = None

    session. sagemaker_execution_role = setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=sagemaker_session_bucket)

    # Mask it
    account_id = sagemaker_execution_role.split(':')[4]
    masked_account_id = mask_account_id(account_id)
    masked_role = sagemaker_execution_role.replace(account_id. masked_account_id)

    print(f"SageMaker role ARN: {masked_role}")
    print(f"SageMaker session region: {session.boto_region_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC
Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker. we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend. session. region. and version. You can find the available versions here

from sagemaker.huggingface import get_huggingface_llm_image_uri


## Fetch docker image URI for the Hugging Face DLC:
# 1. backend name
# 2. Hugging face LDC version


# retrieve the llm image uri
llm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri(
  "huggingface".
  version="0.9.3"
)

# print ecr image uri
print(f"llm image uri: {llm_image}")

Hardware Requirements
Llama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B. 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.

Note: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.

MODEL	INSTANCE TYPE	QUANTIZATION	# OF GPUS PER REPLICA
Llama 7B	(ml.)g5.2xlarge	-	1
Llama 13B	(ml.)g5.12xlarge	-	4
Llama 70B	(ml.)g5.48xlarge	bitsandbytes	8
Llama 70B	(ml.)p4d.24xlarge	-	8
Note: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning. e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.

These are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B. 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks. we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances. since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.

It might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.

4. Deploy Llama2 to Amazon Sagemaker
To deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id. instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type. which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.

Note: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.

import json
import getpass
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel


def get_sagemaker_config():
    # sagemaker config
    instance_type = "ml.p4d.24xlarge"
    number_of_gpu = 8
    health_check_timeout = 300

    # Define Model and Endpoint configuration parameter
    config = {
      'HF_MODEL_ID': "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf". # model_id from hf.co/models

      'HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN': getpass.getpass("Enter your Hugging Face hub token")
      # .'HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE': "bitsandbytes". # comment in to quantize
    }
    return instance_type. health_check_timeout. config

def create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. image_uri):
    # check if token is set
    assert config['HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN'] != "". "Please set your Hugging Face Hub token"

    # create HuggingFaceModel with the image uri
    llm_model = HuggingFaceModel(
      role=role.
      image_uri=llm_image.
      env=config
    )
    return llm_model


def main():
    instance_type. health_check_timeout. config = get_sagemaker_config()
    
    # Set role and image_uri
    role = sagemaker_execution_role
    llm_image_to_ref = llm_image
    
    # Declare llm model with create_hugging_face_model module
    llm_model = create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. llm_image_to_ref)
    
    # Deploy model to the endpoint if llm_model is available
    if llm_model:
            llm = llm_model.deploy(
                initial_instance_count = 1.
                instance_type=instance_type.
                container_startup_health_check_timeout=health_check_timeout
            )
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
5. Run inference and chat with the model
5. Run inference and chat with the model
After our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:

temperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.
max_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20. max value is 512.
repetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. defaults to null.
seed: The seed to use for random generation. default is null.
stop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.
top_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null. which disables top-k-filtering.
top_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling. default to null.
do_sample: Whether or not to use sampling ; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.
best_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs. default to null.
details: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.
return_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.
truncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.
typical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.
watermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.
You can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation

The meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:

[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>

{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]

We create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt. which converts a List of "messages" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.

def build_llama2_prompt(messages):
    startPrompt = "<s>[INST] "
    endPrompt = " [/INST]"
    conversation = []
    for index. message in enumerate(messages):
        if message["role"] == "system" and index == 0:
            conversation.append(f"<<SYS>>\n{message['content']}\n<</SYS>>\n\n")
        elif message["role"] == "user":
            conversation.append(message["content"].strip())
        else:
            conversation.append(f" [/INST] {message['content'].strip()} </s><s>[INST] ")

    return startPrompt + "".join(conversation) + endPrompt
  
messages = [
  { "role": "system"."content": "You are a friendly and knowledgeable vacation planning assistant named Clara. Your goal is to have natural conversations with users to help them plan their perfect vacation. "}
]
# define question and add to messages
instruction = "What are some cool ideas to do in the summer?"
messages.append({"role": "user". "content": instruction})
prompt = build_llama2_prompt(messages)

chat = llm.predict({"inputs":prompt})

print(chat[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Now we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.

# hyperparameters for llm
payload = {
  "inputs":  prompt.
  "parameters": {
    "do_sample": True.
    "top_p": 0.6.
    "temperature": 0.9.
    "top_k": 50.
    "max_new_tokens": 512.
    "repetition_penalty": 1.03.
    "stop": ["</s>"]
  }
}


# send request to endpoint
response = llm.predict(payload)

print(response[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Step 3: Integrate with AWS Lambda
With your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand. navigate to AWS Lambda. Here. create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:

import json
import boto3

ENDPOINT_NAME="jumpstart-dft-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b"
runtime= boto3.client('runtime.sagemaker')

def lambda_handler(event. context):
    data = event["body"]
    print(data)
    
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME.
        ContentType='application/json'.
        Body=data.
        CustomAttributes="accept_eula=true"
    )
    
    response_content = response['Body'].read().decode()
    result = json.loads(response_content)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200.
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }
Step 4: Grant Necessary Permissions
For your Lambda function to work correctly. it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions. create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17".
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0".
      "Effect": "Allow".
      "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint".
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Step 5: Expose Lambda Function as an API
Once your function is ready and permissions are in place. expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.

Step 6: Testing Your Deployment
To test the setup. use a curl command. like the one below:

curl --location 'https://khhg37edhrmibhj4ahsxqnqlha0qoqqc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "inputs":"I believe the meaning of life is".
    "parameters":{
        "max_new_tokens":256.
        "top_p":0.9.
        "temperature":0.6
    }
}'
This command sends a POST request to your Lambda function. which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.

In Conclusion
Setting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process. It offers scalability and ease of integration. making it suitable for a range of applications. For more detailed steps and best practices. you can refer to this official AWS blog.

Futurecasting. - or the art of envisioning the unforeseen. is a crucial skill in our dynamic world where the tide of events can shift unpredictably. Our perception plays a pivotal role in determining how we steer our ship into the future.

Mental Maps and Perceptions
As individuals. we need to acknowledge that our understanding of the future is inevitably tinted by personal perceptions and biases. not objective truths. Each person's mental map. the internal framework we use to navigate decisions. varies. and these maps significantly influence the decisions made regarding the future.

The Risk of Success
Ironically. success might be one of our biggest stumbling blocks. Past triumphs can make us overly reliant on the mental maps that brought us to our current position. A strategy that yielded success in the past isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work indefinitely. and overconfidence in these tried-and-tested mental maps might blind us to other possibilities and opportunities.

The Pitfall of Incorrect Maps
As the legend goes. the first set of Spanish voyagers actually thought that there was a water body connecting south-west and north-west coast of USA. And they made a wrong map. with full confidence. not knowing their mistake. Fun fact. until 16 years. voyagers used the wrong map and after multiple complaints. they were finally able to break the mental model of the government to actually update the map. And that process took 160 years total. The story of the erroneous map of the USA. used for 160 years due to stubborn belief in its accuracy. serves as a telling example. An incorrect understanding leads to misguided actions. and once a particular map (or belief) is accepted. altering it becomes a formidable challenge.

Asking Uncomfortable Questions
Futurecasting is not about comfort; it's about preparedness and openness to disquieting truths. It requires us to challenge our convictions and ask questions that make us squirm. This process involves thinking divergently about what lies ahead. questioning the mental maps we hold dear. and being willing to redraw them as needed.

Navigating with Awareness
Much like skilled sailors navigating the waters with an acute awareness of tides and winds. individuals and organizations need to craft strategies with a deep understanding of global currents and shifts. Where you eventually land is a result of both your goals and the global factors that either facilitate or hinder your journey.

Case in Point: The Oil Business

A look at the oil industry. where success is traditionally measured by rig count. reveals a critical mistake. Businesses often take one scenario. tweak it slightly. and convince themselves that they are working with different models. However. slight variations of a single view do not capture the diversity and unpredictability of the real world.

Learning from IBM

A picture from forecasting by an IBM leader. saying that PCs weren't a good enough market
IBM‚Äôs monumental miscalculation of the PC market potential‚Äîestimated at a few hundred thousand dollars. while the real value was a staggering $30 million‚Äîcost them dearly. The mental maps of their strategists. albeit successful in the past. failed to envision a scenario where PCs would be ubiquitous. missing out on a colossal opportunity and leaving an estimated $200 billion on the table - $100 billion for the software OS (Windows. then called MS-DOS) and $100 billion for the chip making market (that Intel captured)

Scenario Thinking: An Essential Tool
To prevent these decision traps. scenario thinking is invaluable. It helps to mitigate overconfidence. encourages outside-in thinking. enables seeing the full picture. corrects problem framing. and promotes asking the right questions. The goal is not to predict the future accurately but to ask better. more insightful questions. to prepare for a variety of possible futures.


Conclusion
Futurecasting. therefore. is a dance between confidence and humility. knowledge and curiosity. planning and flexibility. It's about continually asking "what if" and being prepared to redraw your mental maps to navigate the thrilling. unpredictable. and often unthinkable tides of the future. Let's escape the confines of our minds and be open to the vast. exciting possibilities the future holds.

Checkout this comprehensive analysis of various stakeholders. factors and strategic outcomes - link

If the very essence of employability is threatened then isn‚Äôt it important to talk about it?
And this time it is different. We talk about how technology shifts have been there. but this time its different. Today there are 78 million jobs that are vulnerable to be automated (IMF Report. 2021). And not enough non-routine. cognitive jobs being created (62mill) to fill this unemployment. gap(IMF Report. 2021). And lets take today‚Äôs discussion to talk about how this unfair wealth battlefield can be given its justice. It is currently important to study how this divide is ‚Äúcreated strongly due to technology‚Äôs impact on employability‚Äù.at this point time - and prepare ourselves for an ambiguous future

1. Job Displacement due to Automation
Automation has pierced through not just manufacturing sectors. but a vast array of industries. radically transforming the employment landscape. Far from being limited to routine and repetitive tasks. modern technological tools are expanding into spaces we once believed were uniquely human: content generation. graphic design. music composition. and even video editing.

Data Snapshot: Forecasts warn that a staggering 800 million workers worldwide could find their roles obsolete by 2030 due to automation. Furthermore. an alarming statistic states that 60% of all occupations have at least 30% of tasks that can be automated. signifying the breadth of the potential impact.
2. The Daunting Skills Gap
The velocity at which technology is advancing presents a conundrum. On one end. there's a surge in tech-centric roles. while on the other. there's a glaring skills deficit. This gap is even more pronounced among certain demographics: the elderly. individuals in rural settings. those encumbered by responsibilities. people with disabilities. immigrants. refugees. and professionals in non-tech domains.

Data Snapshot: The World Bank's 2020 report on the digital economy illuminated the magnitude of this disparity. noting that a mere 1% of Africa's workforce possesses ICT skills. Moreover. Deloitte's findings underline this crisis. with 64% of employees believing their organizations are unprepared to bridge this skills chasm. Adding fuel to the fire. only 17% of institutions are confident about having a future-ready workforce.
3. Escalating Income Inequality
The technological boom has inadvertently created a rift between high-skilled tech aficionados and low-skilled workers. As the former group reaps the benefits of a tech-driven economy. the latter. especially those susceptible to automation. grapples with stagnating or diminishing wages.

Data Snapshot: As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. the wage gap between those armed with a college degree and those with just a high school education has been expanding. The United Nations' ITU highlights another facet. pointing out that a lack of access to digital tools and the internet exacerbates income inequality.
4. Concentration of Wealth: The Tech Elites
It's undeniable that the tech era has given birth to a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals. This isn't just about riches but also the power and influence that come with such immense wealth. from influencing political decisions to shaping economic policies.

Data Snapshot: 2021 data reveals that the collective wealth of global billionaires skyrocketed to over $10 trillion. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. the ten wealthiest individuals added a colossal $450 billion to their coffers. To put this disparity into perspective. the top 1% of the global populace controls more than 44% of the world's wealth.
5. Gig Economy: Freedom or Feudalism?
The gig economy. bolstered by technology. promises flexibility and autonomy. Yet. it's essential to ponder whether it's a genuine avenue for empowerment or merely a modern form of feudalism. where workers. despite being 'connected'. remain isolated and vulnerable.

Data Snapshot: The gig ecosystem has witnessed explosive growth. with 36% of the U.S. workforce engaged in gig roles. cumulatively contributing to a market valued at $204 billion.
In synthesizing these insights. the digital age emerges as a paradox. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. it simultaneously casts shadows of inequality and uncertainty. As we navigate this era. it's paramount that stakeholders ‚Äì from governments to corporations to educators ‚Äì work in tandem to ensure that the digital future is inclusive. equitable. and just.

I did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software. This blog would be the story and the specifics of what a lot of people have asked me over the years. about how I made the switch and some things that you can use too. if you're interested in the same

I'll keep a major part of this blog very generic to the topic "switching streams" in general and then I'll add a section. at the end. about things I did.

Continuous learning is the name of the game
Today. learning anything is completely possible. at any given point. if you're willing to put in the work.

A lot of times we're under the notion that only a few people can learn a skillset based on the course they're "officially" enrolled in or some background experience they've had. I don't believe so. I think. that in this all-knowing YouTube and ever-improving-chatGPT era - anyone can learn anything from the Internet - for free. at their pace and convenience and from tonnes of world leading tutors.

Here are some pointers that might help you:

There is no magical playbook - to learn anything. it takes a lot of time and persistent effort of finding the right material for yourself and creating a roadmap for improving in the skill. So it's fine if you're not having a clear path to start with. There are a couple of channels that can give a clear path. but I think. that just starting from a Google or YouTube search about the topic name is a good place to start.
Taking notes really helps - Even if it's rough screenshots. scribbling random thoughts while learning or just copy-paste's of youtube videos - it works. I'm currently exploring YouTube video summarizer plugin in ChatGPT for this purpose. What's even better is revising and refining notes - for smarter reference later. It's like creating a power pellet from your learnings that you can consume at any point in the future to catch up on the skill super-fast. I used Notion for organizing whatever I've learnt into easily reference-able notes.
Motivation is 2/3rds of the game - Dedicate a fixed time slot for learning and keep struggling to make the most of it. Have very little ego. Initially you might suck - that's cool. But after breaking your head for about 1-2months. you'll not even realize but you'll naturally start seeing patterns and connections. That's the next level.
You shouldn't be afraid to suck at something new and give up if you struggle across even when understanding a paragraph of a new topic. Hell. when I was learning programming. it took me about 12hours to fully grasp and implement a 5 min youtube video about animation. But then. relentlessly pursuing on and on and on. I was able to condense 12 hr worth learnings into 5mins of revision through my notes. It's going to be hard. but if you just stick with it. it's going to be worth it.

The world is project-driven
We live in a fast paced world where most teams just look for how much value an individual can add to their team. If you've independently taught yourself and built impactful projects. no one really cares about your background coming from.

This can be harvested well to your benefit if you want to even your odds with those. who are already in the stream you like. Just build projects that rival with them. And these days YouTube has walkthroughs of any project across any stream for free - it's just so good.

Here are some key pointers to help you in this leg:

Projects are strong applications of learning - Project can mean anything - a tiny robot. a sketch. a basic app. a research paper commentary. a spreadsheet. ¬†a 5sec musical composition. a youtube video - anything. Point is - you're supposed ¬†to have employed your learnings and you're supposed to have worked super hard. It will help grasp the reason of each thing you thought was dumb but you read anyways and help translate it into moving parts of something very impactful
Start by copying other people's work - A good place to start is searching for existing projects on the internet and interpreting and recreating their work. Painters. musicians. writers. chefs - do it all the time while practicing - just patiently learning from the experience of others. This would help avoid pitfalls and learn best practices from your teachers. Again - don't just blind copy as they do. Refer - understand - try to recreate - fail - go back to refer- then understand - then try to recreate and so on.
Add your own flavor to each project - Employ a personalized touch to your project so that its unique. In the early days. I liked reading so when I came to programming projects - I would just add quotes of my favourite personalities in them as my touch. Now for you. it can be anything you like. but once you do this. you just differentiate extremely well from every other person who's just blind-copying and give a polished overall outcome
Tie the project to your ego - I get why this might be a double-edged sword but hear me out. Once you set a benchmark for the finished expectations from a project - tie it to the fact that it's something the world will see as a finished project from "you" and hence it can't fall below a certain quality threshold. For me. it used to motivate me to always push the project to completion and have it satisfy some baseline criteria.
Learn and grow with stakeholders - Some projects. you might not do alone and hence the coolest thing would be to learn from your collaborators and ensure they have a good experience working with you. Believe it or not. people and team skills are still one of the most important virtues for any team. Have fixed meetings. track your progress. hit your metrics and note down and share - what each of you learnt from the project. Projects offer collaborative opportunities and hence you can learn much beyond the books and the internet - you learn from people and in a lot of ways - what you learn will surprise you.
The more you passionately employ your learnings into real-time applications the more strongly your education will stick to you. ¬†

How to sell yourself
The next step after building projects is to share your work with the world and capitalize on it.

Few pointers on this are:

Have an online gallery - Every time you learn something. it would really help if you could maintain a online browsable gallery of your work. Be it your GitHub page or Dribbble gallery or LinkedIn profile or blog page. Just everytime you wrap up learning something. create an online snapshot for the world to view your thinking. approach. knowledge depth etc.
Look for interesting people and DM them: I used LinkedIn. Each time I found a person with interesting work - I would DM (Direct Message) them on LinkedIn and if possible. even get on a call to understand how they thought and learn from them. Seriously. it helps so much to get other people's feedback on your approach. Beyond this. there are obviously interesting conferences that you can just boldly sign up for. attend and be the newbie who talks and learns from everyone.
Confidence is free: In the early days in this new stream. you'll often feel imposter syndrome and underconfident - so start pretending otherwise. With time. it will grow into something more solid and with the knowledge and experience piling on. it would just compound. Confidence also helps express passion and clarity for the subject matter so the more you are confident about your projects and subject matter. the more people would value your work
I guess that about sums it up - in a nutshell - randomly search for ways to learn. iteratively keep sucking till you get better. build toy projects that make you happy and confidently talk about them on platforms. Rest. I'm 100% sure. the journey you take will help you figure out.

My story
Alright. now I'll be more specific about my story and things I did. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. thinking that a good college. a good job would be the only salvation. So naturally. once I got into the 4 year Civil Engineering program at IIT Madras. I thought that this would limit me from pursuing anything lateral. But in this internet-learning driven age. that's hardly the case.

To find what I liked - for a year. I dated a lot of career options - photo and videography. standup comedy. automotive engineering. consulting. designing. architecture and many countless others - mainly through hanging with different clubs of students in my college. ¬†Once I stumbled upon "software startups" I've just felt an irresistable pull to it. that stands to this day. Obviously there are a lot of days where I've doubted it too. but if it's your calling. some part of you always knows and gets attracted to it.

Now the specifics okay. I'll make it pointwise and list specific instructors and courses so that you can maybe check them out:

Disclaimer: You don't have to do it like me. Just read my opinion and do it the way most apt to you :)
I learnt the basics of programming in C Language from the hard copy book - How to C. by Prashant Kanetkar. It took me 4 months with my other college work helps understand the foundation of how a piece of code is designed. written. interpreted and executed.
Next 4 months. I learnt web development (HTML. CSS. JS) from DevEd. WebDevSimplified and Brad Traversy. I also use Laith Harb for time to time learning of new skills. Also. I used to build a lot of toy projects that these youtubers would post walkthrough videos of - this udemy course of 20 projects with Javascript is pretty sweet - link. Also learnt Git during this time
I used to also pursue first 2 hrs of any random long 7-8hr videos from FreeCodeCamp's youtube channel - anything from Data Structures and Algorithms to CyberSecurity to even color designing. I even did a bit of digital illustrations from from Gary Simon.
After this. I was consuming content and courses very fast. In the next 2months I learnt NodeJS. ¬†React and TypeScript. GraphQL. Docker and other misc topics. These are the most common industry technologies in use these days.
I even learnt basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and some Systems Designing from Algoexpert. A good place to start learning the basics of literally anything programming or computer related is Fireship - who does amazing 100second video intros of a tech.
From time to time. I've flirted with Machine Learning and AI courses from DeepLearning. ZeroToMastery and random blogs and projects and stuff. But these 2 sources are very strong for it
Next up. I was having trouble deploying apps and understanding large scale software so I studied systems designing from Gaurav Sen since it helps fall in love with the strength of computing. I also completed certifications from AWS. Google and Microsoft with the help of Stephane Mareek's amazing content
In fact. I feel that Stephane Mareek's course on Cloud Computing is a must-do for any software engineer to appreciate the beauty of internet and all cloud services that become the strong backbone of it. Just do this course. trust me.
Yeah and after that I got into generalist mindset and I was brushing up on everything from Figma for designing to Flutter for app development and was tinkering with over 10 frameworks and DevOps products at any given point for building great software.
To start getting more professional experience. I used to always offer myself up as a cheap developer to startups. I remember cold reaching out to 200+ engineers and founders (not HR since they have less of a say in hiring than actual engineers who lead teams) on linkedin over 4 months before I landed my 1st internship.
In startups. ¬†I could learn a lot everything about businesses - in the high-growth-vacuum environment that startups offer. Plus I made some money. re-invested that back in random tech-courses and business-books that I used to pick like a kid at a candy store and kept building and building a 2nd brain of mine in Notion.
I kept up my spirit and did create projects entirely from scratch on my own right after the 1st 6months even though they felt shitty and didn't work as well. Some. I couldn't even afford to keep running cause I would have to enter credit card details and I didn't have one back then. So I created YouTube videos or blog posts and shared the code as I sunsetted each project deployment. You can find a log here - link. Point is just keep trying honestly.

2nd brain in Notion
Yeah and after that I tried to run my own software startup. made some money and I failed to run it long term (here's the story of it - link).

I balanced all this work with college. Fun thing is. once you do projects. everyone wants to give you a shot - be it professors looking for programmers or startups looking for part-time developers.

A lot of times. people ask me how I managed my time or remembered so much. I do not. I just used "Google Calendar" and practiced using a lot of tools to keep reminding me to meet my goals and do my things. Every night before I go to sleep. I plan my next day's calendar for 10mins to be a good student. programmer. student-club head. brother. son. friend or any role that I feel is important dedicating my time to. Recently I even started to take Mondays to plan 3 to 4 most important things I wanted to achieve in each sphere of life in that week - like learning to cook. or reading a book. finishing an online course. deploying a project. teaching my mom about tech or even learning to play squash or salsa dancing with my friend - I tracked it all so I knew if I was missing out on time for any of my commitments.

My academics did take a hit no doubt - but I knew that I wasn't giving enough time to it and why I wasn't so it was cool.
Recently. I ended up applying to Carnegie Mellon University.

It took me a lot of research and advice - and I made this document to put down my thoughts. goals and opportunities - link. This was the single most important thing I did before choosing what I wanted to do next. I showed this doc to my seniors. people I knew and respected. family and friends and finally collated their advice into a decision.

For applying. here's all I did:

I gave the GRE test (325/340 with 4.5 in essay writing) and TOEFL test (111/120) though I didn't think GRE would have much weightage now. People say you gotta take paid courses and prep for 5 months and I don't believe it. Just mark your calendar. Go through this free material I aggregated in 2022. for GRE and TOEFL and you'll be able to get it done sooner.
Next. I talked a lot about my projects in my SoP. I wrote about majorly. creating impact through startups and software. you can give it a read - link.
My CGPA in academia was 8.01 out of 10 in my undergraduate college. I willingly didn't study as much in class or in pen-paper exams. But I pursued projects passionately and that's where I caught up on.
For Letters of Recommendation - 1. I got from the CEO/Founder 1st startup I worked with for 9months. Next. a letter from a Computer Science professor in my undergraduate whom I helped for free as a DevOps engineer on his logistics project. back in my 3rd year. I got my 3rd reco letter from my favourite Computer Science professor who had taught me 1 course (and that too I didn't score that well XD). but he just looked at my profile and work and decided to give me a shot. And yeah. that's where sometimes just asking gets you to. I just wrote him (and other profs too) an email and he called me for a 20min meeting and decided to help me out
I guess with all of that. I'm now headed for a Masters in Software Management to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I've messed up a lot. Have done a tonne of random things and kept exploring. Some of it worked. Most didn't.


In the end. I just have 1 advice - read a lot of opinions to expand your world view but at the end. internalize all that info with with what feels right in your heart. and trust me. just fuck it and do it.

Here's just a basic email thread exchange I had with 1975 passed-out alumni of Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) - exchanging talks about the way things are at IITM right now in 2023 vs in 1970. What ensued were views about IIT Madras and India in the 1970s. This is a fun anecdotal blog that tells 2 stories from different ages and how. from studying what happens in India's colleges. we can study the broader outlook of technological progress in the nation

1970s
Following is the message from an alum - Sudhir Krishna who passed out in the 1970s

B.Tech was a 5-year program. ¬† Half of the first year was spent toiling in the workshops wearing khaki uniform. ¬† The curriculum was course-heavy: ¬†Usually had 7 courses per semester. and reached 8 courses in the 7th semester (4th year). ¬† Continuous contact hours from 8 AM to 4:15 PM (with lunch from noon to 1:15 PM). ¬† ¬†Not much free time for creative projects except in the final (10th) semester. ¬† ¬†The German collaboration was still evident and some German faculty were still around. ¬† The campus population (students. faculty. administrators. staff) was much smaller than it is now. ¬† ¬†We all had single rooms in hostels. ¬† The annual cultural festival Mardi Gras was started and has now become Saarang (right?). ¬† ¬†Students were multi-talented -- academics. music. chess. bridge. quiz. drama/ acting. mimicry. sports. literary activities. etc. ¬† I myself was captain of the institute chess team. member of the institute tennis team for a couple of years. won the institute debate contest one year. represented IIT-M at the cultural festivals of other IITs. and became Under Officer in NCC Air Wing.
Also. back in the 1970s. India was still a poor country with a socialist economy. ¬† The country's global image was associated with poverty. backwardness. ¬† Only some American universities and companies were aware of the IIT brand. most notably Harvard Business School (where I got my MBA) and management consulting firms like McKinsey. ¬† Even back then. HBS admissions officers said they viewed IIT B.Techs the same way they did MIT and Caltech undergrads. ¬† But they made fun of Indian typewriters that were used for completing the application forms

I received an invitation from McKinsey for an interview that began with "Because of your Indian Institute of Technology background......."

2023
I recently graduated from IIT Madras. The hostel sector is quite lush with trees starting to form canopies above. The monkeys are not only more in number now. but more in daring as well. They're smart. bold and know how to work the system to get what they want.

The academics are strong and flexible with students having the option to pursue whatever they want. irrespective of their BTech department. A lot of application and project based courses have sprung up where we do assignments and mini-projects as opposed to just written exams.

Students are a lot in number now and it's fun to see everyone put honest hard work in their passions - right from technology and sciences to art. music. comedy and gaming. You find people of all interests and talents. The labs and workshop are still hands-on. though only about 40% of what it used to be in the 1970s. The departments have also developing into independent schools of specialization on their own with tonnes of activities. projects. lectures. events. yearly festival and more. In fact. the new department called "Engineering Design" - (near Velachery Gate) offers a lot of product designing and entrepreneurship encouragement in both- ¬†hardware and software. There's the department for management studies. humanities and flexibility of leveraging online platforms like NPTEL (https://nptel.ac.in) apart from attending in-person classes.

Here's my favourite part - the student-run project lab - Center for Innovation at IIT Madras - has over 20 teams and a 2 storey cool building. each one tinkering in topics all the way from AI. robotics. app development and racecar engg to energy efficiency. rocketry. product designing and rural tech (check this for more - https://blog.techsoc.iitm.ac.in/tech-iitm-in-5-mins/). So I'd say recovering from the pandemic. projects are at a powerful high

Hostel culture also seems to be re-igniting. guess a lot of it got hit during the pandemic years but teams like Schroeter. LitSoc and TechSoc are putting the fire back in. Athletics is strong and we won 1st in Men's championship and 4th overall in Inter IIT Sports Meet. We bagged 6 medals in Inter IIT Tech Meet (Golds in AI and entrepreneurship) and came 3rd in Inter IIT Cultural Meet.

In a nutshell. IITM has become the perfect home for pursuing anything passionately
Speaking of animals - monkeys are ruling the hostels so much so that we get a complaint email about monkey assault every week or 2. They're bold and smart and compete for food. ¬†The deer and blackbuck population is also fair and we do hangout with them in lawns sometimes. Dogs were actually moved out of the campus in 2019 since they used to hunt deer. There's a species of red ants we see all the time and snakes are barely spotted once or twice a year during rains. if anytime. Funnily. scorpions are seen near admin buildings and hostels sometimes
Workshops are lighter and we have much more time for creative activities. If you can think of it. there's a club for it working passionately.
On nearby places - Right now. Taramani is still go to for tea. snacks and cigarettes and food delivery orders. There are 2 cycle repair shops in insti. We get great breeze. most likely attributed to the greenery since the construction has blocked out the sea breeze. Student's these days hang out mostly around a huge mall outside Velachery. the food shops along the 100 ft. Road outside Taramani. Elliot's and Marina beach. Chetpet Eco-park this place called "Hidden Lake". Tada waterfalls in Andhra. and Westin bar (if you have money :)). But insti itself is I think the most happening place for so many technical. sport and cultural things that folks barely step out.
On innovation- Self-innovation and Entrepreneurship is being spearheaded by the new Director - Professor Kamakoti. In collaboration with Indian government. Professor Prabhu Rajagopal and his team - is doing several things to help students build products and eventually. companies. In fact. a couple of companies like Ather. HyperVerge. Solinas Integrity - born right inside IIT Madras - are making waves. Most recently Clueso got funded by YCombinator in 2023 and it furthered more students to do this.
On inside insti ¬†- The Dhaba outside Saras is now a full-fledged restaurant with all kinds of Indian food. juices and snacks. It's currently managed by the caterer - Zaitoon - but the tender is open for bids every 3 years. We had to recently monkey proof it due to the stealing incidents XD. The first floor of this is converted into a colorful place with a large television screen for student clubs to sit and ideate. Mummy Daddy Andhra mess outside Taramani is our go-to place for Biryani. Our tuition fees. without scholarship. are now INR 1.00.000 and hostel fees is INR 26.000 for each semester. The hostel bonding. as Srikanth said. is more shifted to clubs and messes are detached from hostels. This has helped in knowing a lot more breadth-wise bonding.
A lot of construction is going on now. There are 2 new Academic complexes. And a new sports complex is being made near the tennis courts
IIT Madras is a lot more creative. entrepreneurial. ¬† Its population is much larger. ¬† The post-graduate programs have grown a lot. ¬† Admissions quotas based on caste and gender have made the student population more diverse. ¬†(We had very few women during our time.) ¬† The IIT brand name is now world renowned. but still based largely on its undergrad B.Tech program and not yet for post-graduate and research programs. ¬† IIT alumni have distinguished themselves in America and reached the highest levels in industry and academia.

Also. India as a country has changed. ¬† It is capitalistic. entrepreneurial and technologically advanced. ¬† The country's nominal GDP is world #5 and projected to become world #3 by 2028. ¬† PM Modi. in my opinion. is a superstar on the global stage and gets royal treatment wherever he goes. ¬† Geopolitically. India is viewed as a counterweight to China. ¬† This is shaping up to be a China-India century and will be very evident by 2050. ¬† As for IITs. there are 23 of them now. ¬† While the 5 original IITs still rank at the top in India. some of the newer IITs are establishing niches of excellence for themselves. ¬†IIT Madras is ranked at the top.

Attaching a couple videos and pictures of campus here for your reference

Fruit juices are still cheap. Canteens still open till 3am. Sunlight still glitters through trees. Students still mess around but have that drive to innovate and lastly - friendships are still stupid and meaningful.

I recently graduated from Indian Institute of Technology. Madras. Here's 8 lessons I learnt from my 8 semesters and stories of how I learnt them so this is not some lame vanity post.


July 2019. entering college
Semester 1: It's a big world and trying everything. even lying outside your comfort zone is free. Be open to talk to everyone and make tonnes of friends. Semester 8 will teach you why its important. I picked up this lesson while borrowing 300 from a hostel guard to pay for pizza at 3am. attempting failed jokes at open mics and also while countlessly sitting in club orientations. It's always a good time to suck at new things :)


Semester 2: It's college. you can sign up for tonnes of things and asking anyone for help is free - people genuinely want to help. I learnt this while being disciplined and trained by the legends of the Raftar Formula Racing team as we championed 3 national trophies against all odds. Discipline and accountability take passion and convert it into wonders.


Semester 3: Just build projects that teach you skills you find cool. Persistence and hard work will help you trump all odds to be good at what you love. Maintaining motivation is 2/3rds of the game. Sitting in a COVID ridden world. using my neighbour (Jay Bafna's) WiFi to learn software development and making dumb projects like todo apps taught me that just inching a little closer to ambition. Preferably start an online presence of you that tracks your work well - write about your work and share


Semester 4: At this point. I'd say start taking bets on yourself and bold risks is the best - you're young - what's the worst that could happen? I learnt this core lesson when I decided to leave home and work at Farmako (YC S20) with a different set of legends. Having very little resources and pure hunger to survive and succeed over 9 months taught me a lot about the brilliant impact a small determined set of people can have on the world. Be stupid. take more bets. You're young and smart - you'll figure it out


Semester 5: You'll see a world of people who seem to have figured it out and gotten it right. But most of us are just winging it. I'd say at this point. just being real with a couple friends and still believing and taking bets is the hard path. I personally learnt it through shit tonne of mistakes. self-doubt and pain and tears that 2 things in life mattered - I was working on something I cared about. and I was around people I loved. I follow this principle to date. Not caring about a lot of external stimuli is a superpower you can acquire by just self-assessing.


Semester 6: You're growing now. Tension is building up and you're probably expected to have figured out life. You don't. In fact it's a good thing if you've failed over 3-4 times by now - it means you're trying and getting back-up enough. Having a vague idea of how you want to spend time - that's something I'd recommend having. A good idea here is take up something. and no matter how much it pains. see it through completion. Working with Logistics Lab. IIT Madras and Coursepanel taught me that enduring and reaching the finish line is way more important than procastinating for perfection or giving up midway. That's a major differentiating factor too.


Semester 7: You're probably multi-tasking at this point. Become boring. routine-driven - use a calendar and documentation tools to string multiple tracks together. Write a lot - it helps unclutter the mind and think clearly. I know it's boring but having control over how your time. energy and money flows by writing stuff down goes a long way. It helps aim long for a year and piece it down to what you and your team need to do today. I learnt this while helping Institute Technical Society (TechSoc). IIT Madras frame its vision from to 1700+ participants. 14 events and countless projects. I learnt that small tasks with directed effort moves mountains.


Semester 8: It's your turn to give back now. Now your old friendships will blossom and it's time to be ready for new ones. Be there as a mentor your junior self would have appreciated. Preferably take up a position of responsibility that's undervalued and difficult and lead a team through and through. no matter what it costs. I think the Inter IIT Technical Meet at Indian Institute of Technology. Kanpur where we went from stranded on a railway station to nailing medals in Kanpur (2000 miles away) in under 40 hours.


Most lessons are not my own and have been taught to me by amazing amazing mentors. friends. family members and I'm undeniably grateful to.

This blog won't solve your problems - hell. mine also took a fuckload of meanderings before I got to understand them. Think of it as more like - not repeating my fuckups. College is a mix of confusion and opportunities. wins and losses - in a short time frame so screw everything and feel free to ping me anytime if you're going through something and need a ear. Listen to all this - but the best part is - don't do it like me. do it like you. üòâ

Machine Learning projects may seem complicated at first glance. but in reality. they follow a systematic flow that. once understood. makes the whole process quite straightforward. In this blog. we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.

Let's first sing a song to kickoff this blog


In a nutshell. what are we gonna talk about
It's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section. I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead. I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!


Steps of ML
0. Become One with the Data
The initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data. identifying potential outliers. and understanding the relationship between different variables.

1. Preprocessing Your Data
Raw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning. normalization. and standardization of values.

When dealing with large datasets. it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as "batches". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor. and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.

2. Creating a Model
Starting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A "baseline" is a relatively simple. existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress. you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.

3. Compiling and Fitting the Model
Once you have decided on your model. the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function. optimizer. and the evaluation metrics. After compiling. fit your model to the training data. allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.

4. Evaluating the Model
After your model has been fitted. it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
In order to improve the model's performance. you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.

Remember. overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting. consider using techniques such as data augmentation. regularization layers. or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.

6. Iterate Until Satisfied
The above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.

8. Explore Advanced Techniques for Improvement
Once you have beaten your baseline. you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model. training for a longer period. finding an ideal learning rate. using more data. or using transfer learning.

Deep Diving into templates and tricks
Processing the Data
The first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it. thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data. where actions such as rotating. flipping. and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.

Shuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset. such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training. consider shuffling your data.

When processing your data. you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:

StandardScaler can give each feature zero-mean and unit standard deviation.
MinMaxScaler provides a non-distorting. light-touch transformation.
RobustScaler is useful for reducing the influence of outliers.
Normalizer provides row-based normalization. using l1 or l2 normalization.
Refer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.

Start with a Baseline
Starting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:

Creating a model: Define the input. output. and hidden layers of a deep learning model.
Compiling a model: Define the loss function. optimizer. and evaluation metrics for the model.
Fitting a model: Train the model to find patterns between features and labels.
Baseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. based on your project's requirements.

PyTorch
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Set the number of epochs (how many times the model will pass over the training data)
epochs = 100

# Create empty loss lists to track values
train_loss_values = []
test_loss_values = []
epoch_count = []

# Put data on the available device
# Without this. error will happen (not all model/data on device)
X_train = X_train.to(device)
X_test = X_test.to(device)
y_train = y_train.to(device)
y_test = y_test.to(device)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    ### Training

    # Put model in training mode (this is the default state of a model)
    model_0.train()

    # 1. Forward pass on train data using the forward() method inside 
    y_pred = model_0(X_train)
    # print(y_pred)

    # 2. Calculate the loss (how different are our models predictions to the ground truth)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred. y_train)

    # 3. Zero grad of the optimizer
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # 4. Loss backwards
    loss.backward()

    # 5. Progress the optimizer
    optimizer.step()

    ### Testing

    # Put the model in evaluation mode
    model_0.eval()

    with torch.inference_mode():
      # 1. Forward pass on test data
      test_pred = model_0(X_test)

      # 2. Caculate loss on test data
      test_loss = loss_fn(test_pred. y_test.type(torch.float)) # predictions come in torch.float datatype. so comparisons need to be done with tensors of the same type

      # Print out what's happening
      if epoch % 10 == 0:
            epoch_count.append(epoch)
            train_loss_values.append(loss.detach().numpy())
            test_loss_values.append(test_loss.detach().numpy())
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch} | MAE Train Loss: {loss} | MAE Test Loss: {test_loss} ")
Tensorflow
# Now our data is normalized. let's build a model to find pattern

# Set a random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# 1. Create a model
model_2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28.28)).
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10. activation="softmax").
])

# 2. Compile the model
model_2.compile(
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy().
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam().
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# 3. Train the model
norm_history = model_2.fit(
    train_data_norm.
    train_labels.
    epochs = 10.
    validation_data = (
        test_data_norm.
        test_labels
    )
)
Plotting training and testing loss
## Plotting training and test loss

# Plot the loss curves
plt.plot(epoch_count. train_loss_values. label="Train loss")
plt.plot(epoch_count. test_loss_values. label="Test loss")
plt.title("Training and test loss curves")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.legend();
Evaluating Our Model
Visualizing our model's predictions and its performance metrics is an integral part of model evaluation. Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems. evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.

Tracking Experiments
Visualizing our model's predictions
Apart from that. a good way to proceed is visualize. visualize. visualize!

It's a good idea to visualize

The data - What data are we working with? What does the data look like?
The model itself - what does our model look like
The training of a model - How does a model perform as it is learning?
The predictions of the model -How do the predictions match up against the ground truth (the original labels)
To visualize our model's predictions. it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values

def plot_predictions(train_data=X_train. 
                     train_labels=y_train. 
                     test_data=X_test. 
                     test_labels=y_test. 
                     predictions=None):
  """
  Plots training data. test data and compares predictions.
  """
  plt.figure(figsize=(10. 7))

  # Plot training data in blue
  plt.scatter(train_data. train_labels. c="b". s=4. label="Training data")
  
  # Plot test data in green
  plt.scatter(test_data. test_labels. c="g". s=4. label="Testing data")

  if predictions is not None:
    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)
    plt.scatter(test_data. predictions. c="r". s=4. label="Predictions")

  # Show the legend
  plt.legend(prop={"size": 14});
To efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations. it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.

Improving Our Model
Build the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....

Improving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation. compilation. and training stages.

During the model creation stage. you might add more layers. increase the number of hidden units in each layer. or change the activation function. In the compilation stage. changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.

This process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as "hyperparameter tuning".

Approaches to improve accuracy

Get more data -> Get a larger dataset that we can train our model on
Hyperparameter tuning -> Use more hidden layers or increase number of neurons in each hidden layer
Train for longer -> Give your model more of a chance to find patterns in the dataset
Save a Model
Saving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment. like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow. depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch. the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().

PyTorch code
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Create models directory 
MODEL_PATH = Path("models")
MODEL_PATH.mkdir(parents=True. exist_ok=True)

# 2. Create model save path 
MODEL_NAME = "01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth"
MODEL_SAVE_PATH = MODEL_PATH / MODEL_NAME

# 3. Save the model state dict 
print(f"Saving model to: {MODEL_SAVE_PATH}")
torch.save(obj=model_0.state_dict(). # only saving the state_dict() only saves the models learned parameters
           f=MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
Run on GPU
Running your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function. where device is set to "cuda" for GPU or "cpu" for the Central Processing Unit.

Conclusion
In conclusion. understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively. Remember. machine learning is an iterative process. and it's okay to go back and forth between steps to improve your model's performance.

Introduction
As we progress in the age of digital transformation. organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework. an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda. is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management. which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless. and how does it function? In this blog. we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.

What is AWS Serverless Framework and How is it Helpful?
The Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes. either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda. you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.

Installing Node.js and Python on Your MacOS Machine
Before we start with the Serverless framework. we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.

To install Node.js. we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:

brew install node

For Python. MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However. it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:

brew install python

To verify successful installation. type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.

Setting Up AWS and Serverless CLI on MacOS Machine
After installing Node.js and Python. it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:

npm i -g serverless

Upon installation. verify the version using serverless -v command.

To deploy your functions on AWS. you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command. replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin

How to Invoke. Deploy. and See Logs of Serverless Lambda Functions
To create a new service or function. use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example. to create a Python service:

sls create --template aws-python --path myService

To deploy this function to AWS. use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only. use sls deploy function -f functionName.

To test a function on AWS. use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.

What is AWS SAM and How to Set it Up on MacOS
AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions. APIs. databases. and event source mappings.

To install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS. first. install the AWS CLI:

brew install awscli

Next. install AWS SAM:

brew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli

Initialize a new SAM application using sam init. choose your desired runtime (e.g.. Python). and template. To build your application. navigate to the project directory and use sam build.

You can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API. you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.

To deploy your application. use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke "FunctionName".

If you need to delete your stack for any reason. you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.

You can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode. click on "Add Debug Configuration" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.

For Python packages management. you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.

Conclusion and Why Serverless is Useful for Cost-Saving
As you can see. the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating. deploying. and managing serverless applications. Moreover. by leveraging these tools. we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.

Serverless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage. it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions. which leads to significant cost savings. especially for applications with variable workloads.

We hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.

TechSoc IIT Madras was one of the most stressful and fulfilling decisions I made in my last year in institute. We upscaled the tech culture at the institute through organizing 20+ competitions. 15+ guest lectures - resulting in 22
products. events impacting 2000+ students. I‚Äôd personally recommend this to any person who shares these 2 traits -

passion of driving a solid tech culture at our university
willingness to test their limits to stand for something bigger than themselves
I‚Äôll talk mainly about 6 things about my tenure as TechSoc Head from 2022 to 2023. where we captured the engagement of over 2000+ students. having conducted 15+ guest lectures and 20+ technical events.

The Initiatives
The Experience
The Growth
The De-merits
A crazy story
Cool stuff I got to do
FYI - Although this blog is all motivational stuff. we failed a tonne of times. but we did end up making people smile and make amazing things - and that's what it's all about.

The initiatives
My approach was and always has been - invest in the team. then invest in the customer and then invest in the future. The fun part about this 3 step process is the more you invest in the earlier phases. you're actually also investing well enough in the latter parts.

Investing in the team
The most important part was always that each member on the team felt proud and challenged and happy about the work we did. They had to grow. they had to be happy and challenge their own problem solving skills - else it wasn't worth it.

So here are a couple things I tried and liked:


not the full team. some suckers missed picture day
A training period
Spent atleast a month for new joinees to get used to "entrepreneurial activities" - like studying companies. making presentations and pitching. drafting detailed reports. running collaborative projects. cold emailing. corporate relations. This helped the team learn a lot in a short period of time and gain confidence.

Here's a syllabus if it helps - link

But yeah. if you want top-quality. hard-working. smart people actually working with you on your vision - gotta train your army to fight. You can start by defining the vision of your team. and what culture you want to carry into this.

Meeting structuring
College is a complex time with lotta priorities. commitments and spontaneous plans. It is important to have a definite meeting structure so that you stay consistent and add a punctuality aspect to respect everyone's time.

If anyone came late. they bought ice-cream to everyone who came before.
If the meeting didn't end on time. then I would buy ice-cream for everyone in the meeting
Every meeting had a document and actionables that people could take back so we always met with a direction. discussed agenda as per time and walked away with usable data and direction.
This structure is something I learned from Sharavanakumar at Khatabook and to this day. I'm grateful for it.

OKRs
OKRs - helping break down the overall vision into just 3 things each of the 18 of us had to get right each week - while working with each other. We were 18 disruptors - 54 things per week. pointing in 1 direction - helped us grow like crazy.

Team Happiness and Culture
At TechSoc. you always get a birthday cake. If you're in person - team folks even show up for your celebration at 12AM. We ensured that in our weekly retros. we had shoutouts for everyone who did great work in that week. Every event we saved on. the surplus would go back to team treats and gifting goodies. We were transparent about our money and trusted each other with it. Apart from that. we'd enjoy late night sessions on the lawns playing games (Mafia. Truth and Dare. "Albatross") or singing or sharing stories about ourselves.

Investing in the experience

give them pizza. they will build amazing things
Every event at TechSoc was a collaboration with another technical team on campus. And they're usually busy with projects but do want the publicity on campus. Every meeting we had with them. went as follows:

Why are we doing this event? What do we want to takeback from it
What does the event do? What's the best date and why?
How will the overall flow of conducting look like?
How do we market it?
What do we need (human resources and props) to run it successfully?
What are some loopholes we should consider when organizing this?
Metrics tracking and SWOT analysis
All this information would then be captured in a document - sample. This document would contain all the plan. the necessary links and people collaborating on it.

On ground. here are some values we ensured each time we conducted the event

Participant is god. If it means you're cycling with one hand and doing repeated samosa deliveries. sticking posters everywhere or ensuring that they have water - you gotta do it.
TechSoc never gives up. No matter how much things screw-up. And they did. like. all the time. Once there was an internet issue in a seminar we were streaming while a billion dollar CEO waited on the other end. But we recouped and did the damn thing
After-event work happens super fast. Everything from prizes. to score updation. to social media. website updating and everything.
Investing in the big picture

Mandakini hostel team. who made a car that did obstacle detection realtime
"Always build on top of your previous work". A lot of what we did at TechSoc compounded in on itself over time. We started with arguing and justfying INR 7000 rupee budgets for paper plane events and in 1 year got to INR 1.5 lakh AI hackathons. The way to do this was:

Update the fricking website - ensure that the overall presence of TechSoc was always up to date with everything that we had achieved so other people could review. With time. as we did more things. we became more awesome and it kept compounding with time. This helped get external attention and investment as well.
Build extensive documentation - Every document. going in. with time. created such a strong clarity and database - everything from important contacts to event documents and plans and costs and the whole thing - just mind-blowing. It helped a lot of people collaborate and introspect and evolve work with time.
Align everyone. Repeatedly - Every meeting. or party. or failure point - it was super important to just tell everyone what we stand for.
The Experience
Technical Society is a relatively growing student body and so the job is obviously hard. The place my team had to start from was how to even get 5 people to show up for an offline event when we were reeling back from the pandemic. Key points of my experience are:


the aero contingent team from our university (L to R - Akshat. Ayush. Pranit. Reddy Anna. my Alak boi. Sukriti)
It‚Äôs a fricking rollercoaster - There are events that go super well and then there are others where 0 people show up. My highs were really high and lows were equally painful. I‚Äôve wanted to quit and dump so many times but then there were equally balanced nights of euphoria and adrenaline
It‚Äôs about the team- Investing in the team‚Äôs growth during the summer following my recruitment was one of the best decisions I made. Because this strong loyal team stood while we encountered multiple hits over failed early events in the first semester. And now I see the same shy-to-even-turn-on-their-video-camera students stay up 14 straight hours. jugaading food and leading the conduction of tech events on campus.
Diplomacy is everything - I‚Äôve had to be nice in multiple f-you conversations and taken a lot of sit from multiple participants and stakeholders at a lot of points. Being rational more than emotional. knowing the right words to pitch to the right decision maker for an approval. collaborating with other student bodies for mutual vision alignment - that kind of thing
The tech community has heart - Tech-community is introverted. reserved and fit the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù description (barring a few outliers). But these are the same people who will pour their heart out for finessing a project - right from scribbling on whiteboards to presenting products. stand by and help each other for free. bond over late night tea conversations and pizzas. fight when they‚Äôre sleep deprived and drive real impact to push the society forward. This inspirational set of people is worth fighting for
The Growth
Gigantic network - This is the most golden essence of being in an technology college. I reached out far and wide:

interacted and connected with the most passionate tech enthusiasts across all domains at my university
connected to nationwide college's top talent through a joint Tech board
became part of a top class university entrepreneur community
multiple companies (GitHub. Unacademy) that sponsored our events
Being a better planner - Every TechSoc event had to be granularly figured out - right from the why. to the domain. to the logistics (approvals. finances. food). marketing plans. grading patterns. feedback loop and process documentation. And prior to that - figuring out which initiatives to run for which target audience and how that tied into the TechSoc vision to provide something to students that they were missing out on.

TechSoc taught me about this more than anything. You have to be a better planner than you ever were when you‚Äôre handling over 5 Lakhs of budget and getting around 30-40 things right in stressful weeks.

Becoming a stronger person - A leader is looked up to be a responsible and strong person. But no one is born that way. You learn by getting hit with a brick in the face. I learnt to be resilient. have more patience. lose the fear of crowd handling. stand my ground in hard negotations. take in a lot of negative feedback and deal with some failures. There were a lot of times when I felt like running away from the problem but the beauty of this PoR is that it won‚Äôt let you. Even when you‚Äôre tired. or tied by administration or resource constrained and super close to giving up. It has definitely increased my self-confidence to stand up to any problem in the world with a - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre TechSoc. we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù attitude.

Being part of something bigger - I had a chance to stand for a strong tech culture at my college - even though it sometimes meant being unhealthily altruistic. Looking back. I‚Äôll have not regretted that I spent my last year complaining about not having a strong tech scene at univer. I‚Äôll carry with me the legacy of having led highly passionate believers who wanted to push the limits of what technology can be.

The De-merits

passing out after 40hrs on non stop competition work and logistics
Constantly stressed - In the early days. especially with the offline shift and even during the competitions. I felt responsible for too many things. It‚Äôs an unprecedented level of stress - that no one should rationally take. Passion might be good reason to do it. but not otherwise. You‚Äôre worried for an event. a team member‚Äôs growth. someone resigning. some plan getting delayed and simultaneously 0 participation in another event on the next day. Since the team is small. unlike other bodies. you‚Äôre involved personally in most things and while the growth is good - the cost it comes at. is also high
Personal sacrifices - Barely any time on most weekends. I remember just bouncing across meetings post 8pm on a lot of weekdays and then standing by the team. I‚Äôve missed a lot of social life. sometimes even personal goals (heck. I didn‚Äôt work on my startup during national competitions) and relaxing. as I struggled to move the needles of 3 different verticals whilst the cores were still warming up. The role does take a lot out of you and it‚Äôs not a good thing always.
A lot of ground-work - My leadership style has always been more hands-on. Might be a good or bad thing. I don‚Äôt know the balance. There are days when people won‚Äôt work upto your standards and you‚Äôll have to step in and help even though you really are just mad and might want to panic and yell at them to get it done. Compassion taught me to share the load - right from being a TShirt distributor to a sweeper to poster designer to food delivery agent.
A crazy story
I'll tell a story of how I learnt persistence. In 2023. I was leading a 90 member contingent from our university to participate in Inter IIT Tech Meet (a national level competition for solving technical challenges). I was managing 15 projects over 2 months and was also in charge of the logistics. travel and accommodation in Kanpur. I booked the train tickets for my contingent through our institute and they assured us of tickets to Kanpur. However. in on the day of travel. amidst 100+ things I juggled all the way upto the train station. I realized that our tickets from Chennai to Kanpur were waitlisted. The train was full and keeping in mind the safety of my team. I told them to get off and said we'd find another way. And so. this story begins with a huge group ¬†of people. staring down at me at 12am on a railway station. with hopes that I'd get them to our competition - 2000 miles away - in the next 36 hours.

I arranged for a bus back to the campus and stayed up till 3. trying to figure out how I'd get my team to Kanpur safely. with the limited budget I had. For context. our institute had a no-flight refund policy for competitions. We brainstormed multiple routes via permutations of bus and train but we'd reach late and fatigued. At 3:15am. Shreepoorna found a reasonable flight ticket deal from Chennai to Delhi. At 3:30am. I poured in all my personal savings of about INR 85000 (with a INR 10000 loan) and booked the tickets to Kanpur. Here's the celebration video of that too.


the moment the tickets for kanpur were booked at 3:30am (gut feeling- all these people are going to make great founders 1 day)
Next. I spent 2 hours breaking it to the 2 people. whose tickets couldn't be booked due to limited funds. At 4am. I was standing at Cauvery Hostel. getting rattled by a junior on how I'd failed my entire purpose as a leader. Returning to my room in a mess. I wrote a long email to the Dean. explaining the situtation before I passed out.

After a 1 hr nap. I woke up in cold sweats. informing our Dean with a long email - the entire situation. 9am. I showed up to their office. shaking. But the admin rallied with us and with their support. got the tickets for the remaining team as well.

After 2 hours we flew to Delhi. In-flight. I worked with the people solving the "entrepreneurship challenge" and got their submission right. Abhishek Gupta (on campus) was making the pitch deck all the way to 12 when we submitted it. before we finally got kicked out of the cafe we made our makeshift office. with just a single coffee order. Next. at Delhi. we haggled and arranged bus transport to Kanpur for all with a 40% discount. Turns out. back then. online bookings weren't considered valid and you had to physically haggle and get people in the bus.

Fun fact. we got screwed over by the bus guys who dropped us about 25km away and once again. stranded on a highway at 7am. our team is bargaining with auto drivers to get us there.

Finally. after the entire long journey. we reached Kanpur campus 10 hours before time. 24 hours after that. with a parched throat. I pitched and won the silver medal for my college at the entrepreneurship challenge. Oh and the savings I put in? I got them reimbursed a month later by tweaking around my cloud provider SaaS costs and showing AWS credits as expenditure (technically. I did lose the money).

This is my favourite story that I like to share as I can neither put it in my resume nor will it be a conventional interview question - but it is so fundamental to my way of working - Persistence. I'd rather sweat in a garage than recline in a cabin. Cause where other's see unconvention. I see genius. "Ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. are the ones who really do"

Here's another story blog I wrote about an initiative TechSoc created and ran - to motivate students to believe and build projects - link

Okay so this post is not actually about college ragging but majorly about Retrieval Generated Augmentation (RAG). a cool machine learning and indexing application I came across while building CloudPilot - "the copilot for cloud engineers"

What is CloudPilot? ‚úàÔ∏è
CloudPilot was a project we built with the vision of going from idea to cloud within 10 minutes.

The goal of the project was to enable any thinker to start with a business problem. quickly to research and come up with a wholesome engineering document that had the solution approach. its architecture and performance analysis done well in under 10 minutes.

This product was built at a hackathon in under 24 hours. Let me know if there are any improvements you want me to look at.

And with that. let's dive in. into the product flow



What does a cloud engineer do?
First. let's understand how cloud architects function and come up with infrastructure solutions for a given business problem. See. as a typical cloud architect - the flow is as follows

Step 0: - It starts with a problem statement such as a architecture for payment gateway or a data migration pipeline or a high availability server fleet setup.
Step 1: Ask the right questions - Several times. we go back and forth with the problem statement to understand what are the exact business requirements and what are important aspects that we need to optimize for.
Step 2: Research - With the given requirements. the standard approach is to go online. read up some blogs by cloud providers. read case studies and open source articles to get context and understand our problem statement. Here. typically a lot of time is just spent in finding the right article. Most software problems have precedents that have solved the requirement wholly or in parts. Hence. finding the right documentation for similar requirements is of paramount importance.
Step 3: Technical Requirements - Once we have asked the right questions. we prepare a brief technical document. highlighting the most important performance expectations from the software and then start researching what kind of cloud offerings do we require. We also quantify that to what extent do we want to look at satisfying a particular goal. eg: 500 TB of storage. 80ms latency in communication. 7 0s of availability. 8GB GPUs for ML training.
Step 4: List the building blocks - Here. we simply map each techinal requirement to an existing cloud service we can use and do a comparative analysis. If it's ML. it's gotta be Google Cloud. for availability and cost. it's gotta be AWS - that kinda thing. So we start listing cloud offerings such as EC2 (AWS). Maps API (Google Cloud) or Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Azure). We think of using these offerings as builing blocks for the entire architecture and justify why the offering is important
Step 5: Join the blocks - Here. we join together the building blocks as services that communicate with 1 another and draw a systems diagram that helps to understand how the overall system works. Which part does what function and how it's role fits into the overall requirement.
Step 6: Iterate - Once an end-to-end flow is ready. we do overall Product. Engineering and Cost Analysis and then we iterate upon the design to optimize for certain aspects - make it faster. make it cheaper. increase the storage. increase the redundancy - that kind of thing. And based on that. we improve the choice of building blocks and integrating them together in 1 system
Step 7: Templatize - Once a cloud architecture is ready. we start looking at using Cloud templates such as CloudFormation by AWS. Terraform by Hashicorp to easily just deploy the entire architecture and have a skeleton of it functional to understand performance on a practical level.
Thus. this is the overall flow of the entirety of coming up with a cloud architecture. Beautiful and methodical.

So if we were to copilotize this process we would need an AI agent who could read through all cloud architecture related blogs. docs. case-studies like an engineer and intuitively go through steps 1 to 8 and help arrive upon a solution.

And that's why we used something called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique where we retrieved the right list of documents from the internet and asked our Large Language Model to generate an answer from text that it studied from these docs.

Before we segway into what we did. let's study in short - what is this "Retrieval Augmented Generation" anyways?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)


Imagine you're a chef and you're trying to create a new dish. First. you go to your pantry (which has a vast array of ingredients). This is akin to the retrieval part. You take a look at different recipes you have used in the past or a recipe book for ideas. You fetch or 'retrieve' ingredients and inspiration based on these recipes.

Next. you start to combine these ingredients together. perhaps in a way you've never done before. You might modify some of the recipes to match your taste or to make the dish unique. This is similar to the 'generation' part of the process.

Now. let's say you have some guests coming over and you know their preferences. To accommodate them. you decide to modify your new dish even further or add some garnish to make it look more appealing. This is comparable to the 'augmentation' part. where you make some tweaks to make the final result better suited for its purpose.

Bringing it back to the context of AI and natural language processing. Retrieval-Generated Augmentation is a method where you:

'Retrieve' relevant data or content from a large dataset (like a chef searching through the pantry or recipe books).
'Generate' new data or content based on this retrieved data (like a chef creating a new dish using the fetched ingredients). and then
'Augment' this generated content. usually by making some modifications to better suit the task at hand (like a chef adjusting the dish to suit the guests' taste).
This method is very useful for tasks that involve generating text or other types of data. especially when you want to produce content that is tailored for a specific task. purpose. or audience.

It's also a way to improve the performance of machine learning models. by providing them with a richer. more varied dataset to learn from. The richer and more varied the 'ingredients' (i.e.. the data). the better the 'dish' (i.e.. the model's output) can potentially be.



How we built the damn thing
Part 1: "Retrieve"
For this we would leverage the open-source documents. blogs. systems diagrams and articles by major Cloud Providers such as AWS. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

We created a custom index of just these documents. Using Amazon Kendra. we indexed over 192000 such information webpages using its web-connector. Here. the major difficulty we faced was understanding which XML sitemaps did we have to index and how. Some documents were in Japanese and some were just plain irrelevant marketing content. So intelligent document structure filtering was required at this level to index the right documents for our search.

Thus. this helped us to get the best documents to pull in for a given query. For example the queries below.




Using Kendra for getting top documents for a given search query
Part 2: "Generate"
Alright so you've got the top 10 documents you're supposed to refer to. But how can we improve the experience of gleaning valuable insights for your given business problem? That's where we use the superpower of an LLM. It's like asking it to read all documents and answer over it

So. once we "retrieve" the documents from Amaz√∏n Kendra. we ask the LLM to take the top 5 most relevant documents. pass all the text in them as tokens to the LLM (number of tokens varies depending on the LLM. we used GPT-4 by OpenAI that takes in upto 8000 tokens). The LLM parses the text and via few-shot learning over the context of business problem and the documents from Kendra. "generates" a response for the end user.

This is the simple task. Get the relevant docs and then generate a textual response from the same. Let's improve the experience now.



Part 3: The end-to-end architecture
Stringing together this in an entire experience involved developing the following flow.

Get the input prompt for the business requirement from the user and generate a set of relevant questions about the business to ask the user. For this we used an LLM


We recorded the question answers and the business requirement. did some text summarization and trimming (using nltk to remove whitespaces. punctuations etc.) and then we pass it all as a cumulative context for searching best documents in Amazon Kendra

Next. we get the best docuements from Amazon Kendra as text. combine that with business prompt and QnA and pass it to our LLM for giving a textual response

Once we get the response. we return that. along with hyperlinks to the documents that Kendra returned so the user can get our summarized.structured answer as well as refer the source documents for more information at their own leisure

To help the cloud engineer with more specific information. we added a feature to generate the following from the textual answer
6. Systems diagram for the architecture proposed to understand how to link together the building blocks
7. IaaC code template - Basically a CloudFormation code template to quickly just spin up the architecture and study its performance and behavior in cloud
8. Cost estimation - based on information that the LLM has been trained on. using AWS pricing docs as data source

Lastly. we provided a chat interface for the user to keep passing more requirements (such as "make it cheaper?". "make the system faster?") to the service. Now. we pass a combination of these 4 things to the LLM to get an improved answer = original business prompt + QnA + generated answer + additional user request



What can we improve upon?
Here's the current complete system that was built:



Okay so this project was awesomely exciting but the main complaint I have from it is that it is too slow. It still takes 2 minutes to generate answers and diagrams. A way to improve that would be some compute on frontend or some level of caching

Also. the answers are still generic and unless the prompt is well-engineered. we wouldn't discover novel architectures and solutions. So. that's something we need to fine-tune for. Maybe some sort of a framework for the user to engineer their prompt even better. Asking better technical requirement questions for a given business prompt could be a good starting point.

Lastly. it's expensive. Kendra is expensive and so is using OpenAI. So the approach for solving this is - open-source it! A search index with Elasticsearch combined with a custom LLM such as the Llama. Lima and Flan-T5 models can help cut down on costs

Oooh. a cool feature could have also using voice to speech and language translation (with using localized cloud services docs) to provide multilingual support to our beloved copilot

In closing....
We're having a copilot for pretty much everything these days ever since the Generative AI hype cycle started so I just thought of creating something that could help engineers to better adopt the Cloud Services by any cloud and help leverage them in the best possible way

Here are some useful reference links:

I'd rather sweat in a garage then recline in a cabin
The story for this starts with wanting to figure out how a student can get from point A in skillset to point B in skillset (their desired ambition) - given an educational ecosystem that provides certain opportunities. And we did realize it. atleast for 3000+ students in my undergraduate college.

I ran Coursepanel for a year and we built several cool things in this journey. I'll keep this blog fairly technical but also throw in certain snippets about entrepreneurship and lessons learnt along the way. Most of this blog is going to be about the technical implementation of this project. I have mentioned my learnings as an entrepreneur in the end.

To read the story of the early days and launch. checkout - here


Technical Deep-dive
Understanding Natural Language Processing and Vector Embeddings
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science. artificial intelligence. and linguistics. It involves programming computers to effectively process large amounts of natural language data. As part of NLP. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. developed by OpenAI. are designed to generate human-like text based on the inputs they receive. They are trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate contextually relevant text.

However. they do not know specific documents or sources they were trained on and don't have the capability to access or retrieve specific documents or databases during the generation process. Their strength lies in understanding and generating text that closely resembles human-like responses. thus forming a key part of systems like CourseGPT.

Vector embeddings are another crucial component of such systems. In the realm of machine learning. embeddings are a way to convert categorical variables into continuous vectors so as to feed them into a model. They can be used to capture the semantics of words in a language. relationships between items. and even user behavior in an application.


Basic demo of how words are converted into vector embeddings (source)

These embeddings. when stored in a vector database. form the basis of effective search and recommendation systems.

Building a vector database using a knowledge graph
For the purpose of this project. based on the previous training data. we turned our knowledge graph (aka ‚Äúskillmap‚Äù) into a vector database for storing entries and answering queries related to academic data. This was done in 4 steps:

Creating a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j: The first step involved modeling our data as a graph and storing it in Neo4j. Our nodes represent entities such as NPTEL courses. books. departments. etc.. and relationships represented the connections between these entities
Generating Vector Embeddings: The next step involved generating vector embeddings from our graph. These embeddings are a form of representation that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of your data in the form of vectors in a high-dimensional space. There are several techniques to generate graph embeddings. like Node2Vec. GraphSAGE. etc. This project used the Node2Vec library in Python to achieve the same. We ran Node2Vec algorithms on our Neo4j graph to generate node and relationship embeddings.
Store Vector Embeddings: The generated embeddings then needed to be stored for future use. Typically. we‚Äôd want a database that is optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. You could use a vector database like Pinecone. Faiss. or even Elasticsearch with a vector plugin for this purpose.
Querying the Vector Database: The final part involved using these vector embeddings to make our application smarter. For example. we could now perform operations like semantic search. recommendations. or similarity checks by comparing vectors. This involved querying our vector database for the nearest vectors to a given input vector. which gave us the most semantically similar entities to our query.
Scoping NPTEL data into the Vector Database and building a chatbot
To create a system like CourseGPT. we first need to load the relevant data into the vector database. Let's assume we have course data from NPTEL in a CSV format. This data can be processed and converted into vector embeddings using various techniques like Word2Vec. GloVe. or even using transformers-based models. These vector representations can then be loaded into the vector database. which allows us to perform efficient similarity search operations.

The vector database enables us to compare the query vector (which can be a representation of a user's query or a specific course interest) with all vectors in our database. and retrieves the most similar entries. These entries represent courses that are most relevant to the user's query.

Once the entries are returned. we need to translate these course vectors back into a human-readable form. This is where LLMs like GPT-3 come into play. These models can generate contextually relevant. human-like text based on the returned entries. The generated text can be as simple as a course name and description. or as complex as a detailed career path recommendation.

In this way. the synergy of NLP. LLMs. and vector databases leads to the development of an effective system like CourseGPT. Such a system can revolutionize the way we approach professional upskilling and corporate training by providing personalized. contextual. and interactive learning experiences.

The journey in a nutshell
The development and evolution of CourseGPT. spread over a 12-month period. could've been a significant step forward in the application of advanced technologies such as AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP). and Knowledge Graphs to the critical area of professional upskilling and corporate training.

The journey began with understanding the problem domain. setting the objectives and scope. and constructing the methodology flowchart. The decision to pick a test sandbox environment of similar nature proved instrumental in aligning the development of CourseGPT closely with the real-world challenges encountered in professional learning and development.

Deep dives into models of corporate training. specifically the Kirkpatrick Model. provided insights into the metrics for successful training outcomes. Skill mapping using a knowledge graph emerged as a novel and efficient approach to resolving course recommendations and facilitating an effective learning journey for the students.

Working with the NPTEL team and building a skill map for IIT Madras underscored the potential of this tool in academic environments as well. Implementing Natural Entity Recognition and NLP allowed us to extract valuable course tags and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Moreover. the research conducted at HyperVerge Academy (HVA) enabled a deeper understanding of the professional upskilling space. Facing and overcoming various challenges along the way. we succeeded in developing a competency engine and data model that significantly enriched the capabilities of CourseGPT.

Finally. CourseGPT emerged as an intelligent product. leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to recommend courses based on career goals. plan academic journeys. solve student doubts. and inclusively cater to diverse learners. The journey. although filled with complexities and challenges. offered valuable insights into the future of AI-enabled learning and set a foundation for ongoing research and development.

Here's the various launch videos of products that I built. just as a nostalgic flash from the past.





Why I failed to run it as a company.
With Coursepanel. we made around 35000 INR in revenue with 3000+ free users and then got stuck in a loop of developing without continuous customer interaction. I shut down Coursepanel in May 2023. I was embarassed. mentally disturbed and self-doubting when I did it. It was hard and it was like I had given up on a dream ¬†and failed myself. But picking up and moving on is the way forward. Here are a few things I learnt from this experience - these aren't novel learnings - these are the same fuckups most startup folks advise against but I did it anyway and learnt it again - at a heavy price:

Don't do it alone. It's not that I'm doubting individual capability - it's just that context switching has a very difficult toll when you ¬†want strong velocity in both business and innovaiton. Also there's the emotional burden of doing it alone. Worst case. atleast have a friend to talk to and help sort out a lot of operations and communications
It's best to build a shitty product with continuous customer interaction but no point of siloed building. no matter what you feel about current systems. Even asking and then building then again asking then building - i.e. an intermittent month-to-month setup might not help. Atleast talk to users each week.
Make money from the start. It's the only way to stay afloat.
Don't get to emotionally attached to your innovation or amazed by exciting new things you can do. Focus on the minimum that gets you paid. get it right and then expand with bolder experiments.
It's boring and requires discipline and routine to continuously outperform other teams. You have to consistently just keep pushing. Motivation is 2/3rds of this game.

So yeah. I guess that's about it. I was very passionate. worked very hard and was heartbroken - but I guess I'm carrying forward a lot - something that classroom would have never taught me. Let's see. I'm about to do something again in the Generative AI space. This time - business first though - get the "what are people gonna pay for" right and then expand from that base thought into technical innovation and exquisite design.

Problems define markets
Having a more accurate understanding of the market in which your product is really competing
A market is not tied to any specific solutions that meet those needs. That is why you see ‚Äúmarket disruptions‚Äù: when a new type of product (solution space) better meets the market needs (problem space)
The ‚Äúwhat‚Äù describes the benefits that the product should give the customer‚Äîwhat the product will accomplish for the user or allow the user to accomplish.
The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the way in which the product delivers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to the customer. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is problem space and ‚Äúhow‚Äù is solution space.
üí°
What = problem space
How = solution space
Lean product teams articulate the hypotheses they have made and solicit customer feedback on early design ideas to test those hypotheses.

Should you listen to customers?
It‚Äôs true that customers aren‚Äôt going to lead you to the Promised Land of a break-through innovative product. but customer feedback is like a flashlight in the night: it keeps you from falling off a cliff as you try to find your way there.

Using the solution space to discover the problem space
Hard for customers to talk about abstract benefits and the relative importance of each‚Äîand when they do. it‚Äôs often fraught with inaccuracies
This can be solved by techniques like "contextual inquiry" or "customer discovery"
The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. If you show them a new product or design. they can tell you what they like and don‚Äôt like. They can compare it to other solutions and identify pros and cons.
The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created
Divergent and convergent thinking
You should be practicing divergent thinking. which means trying to generate as many ideas as possible without any judgment or evalua-tion. There will be plenty of time later for convergent thinking. where you evaluate the ideas and decide which ones you think are the most promising.

you want to capture all the ideas that your team generated. then organize them by the benefit that they deliver.
Then. for each benefit. you want to review and prioritize the list of feature ideas.
You can score each idea on expected customer value to determine a first-pass priority.
The goal is to identify the top three to five features for each benefit.
There is not much value in looking beyond those top features right now because things will change‚Äîa lot‚Äîafter you show your prototype to customers.
A user story is a brief description of the benefit that the particular functionality should provide. including whom the benefit is for (the target customer). and why the customer wants the benefit.

üí°
As a [type of user]. I want to [do something]. so that I can [desired benefit].
¬†eg : As a professional photographer.I want to easily upload pictures from my camera to my website.so that I can quickly show my clients their pictures. ¬†

üí°
INVEST framework
I - independent of other stories
N - not explicit and must be flexible. open for discussion
V - valuable to customer
E - reasonlaby estimate scope
S - small
T - testable
¬†

Small tickets and smaller ticket batch sizes are better
Break tickets into atomic chunks. Trim extra stuff
The batch size is the number of products worked on together at the same time in parallel. Faster velocity of small batches -> faster feedback -> reduce risk and waste
The longer you work on a product with-out getting customer feedback. the more you risk a major disconnect that subsequently requires significant rework.
Scoping with story points
Story points - type of currency for estimating relative ticket size
Have a max threshold for story points
Good operating principle ¬†- break down stories with high points into smaller stories
Return on investment to prioritize
When you are building a product or feature. the investment is usually the time that your development resources spend working on it. which you generally measure in units such as developer-weeks (one developer working for one week).
It‚Äôs true that you could probably calculate an equivalent dollar amount. but people use units like developer-weeks because they are simpler and clearer
Visualizing ROI

Good product teams strive to come up with ideas like idea G in Figure 6.1‚Äîthe ones that create high customer value for low effort.
Great product teams are able to take ideas like that. break them down into chunks. trim off less valuable pieces. and identify creative ways to deliver the customer value with less effort than initially scoped‚Äîindicated in the figure by moving idea G to the left.
The accuracy of the estimates should be proportional to the fidelity of the product definition
The main point of these calculations is less about figuring out actual ROI values and more about how they compare to each other
¬†

Approximating ROI and Deciding on MVP candidate

Just comparing feature importance wrt one another. Once that‚Äôs done. arrange all features in this format as per benefit categories


Intentionally give them generic names so that you can more easily envision replacing them with what would be relevant for your product. ‚ÄúM1A‚Äù means feature chunk A for must-have 1. ‚ÄúP2B‚Äù means feature chunk B for perfor-mance benefit 2. and ‚ÄúD2C‚Äù means feature chunk C for delighter benefit 21.
Decide on the MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONALITY that will resonate with TG users
Look down the leftmost column of feature chunks and determine which ones you think need to be in your MVP candidate. While doing so. you should refer to your product value proposition
After this. focus on the main performance benefit you‚Äôre planning to use to beat the competition
Delighters are part of your differentiation. too. You should include your top delighter in your MVP candidate.
So if you‚Äôve made tentative plans beyond your MVP. you must be prepared to throw them out the window and come up with new plans based on what you learn from customers.

Moving on to MVP and early Prototyping
Use the broad term MVP ‚Äúprototype‚Äù to capture the wide range of items you can test with cus-tomers to gain learning. While the first ‚Äúprototype‚Äù you test could be your live MVP. you can gain faster learning with fewer resources by testing your hypotheses before you build your MVP.

What is/isn't an MVP?

There has been spirited debate over what qualifies as an MVP. Some people argue vehemently that a landing page is a valid MVP. Others say it isn‚Äôt. insisting that an MVP must be a real. working product or at least an interactive prototype.
The way I resolve this dichotomy is to realize that these are all methods to test the hypotheses behind your MVP. By using the term ‚ÄúMVP tests‚Äù instead of MVP. the debate goes away
Product vs Marketing MVP Tests

Marketing test - You‚Äôre simply describing the functionality to prospective customers to see how compelling they find your description
MVP Tests - validate your product will involve showing prospective customers functionality to solicit their feedback on it. You may be showing them a live beta product or just low fidelity wireframes to assess product-market fit
Marketing tests can provide valuable learning. but they‚Äôre not an actual product that creates customer value. At some point. you need to test a prototype of your MVP candidate
Quantitative vs Qualitative MVP Tests

Qualitative - you are talking with customers directly. usually in small numbers that don‚Äôt yield statistical significance eg: If. for example. you conducted one-on-one feedback sessions with 12 prospective customers to solicit their feedback on a mockup of your landing page. then that would be qualitative research

Quantitative - conducting the test at scale with alarge number of customers. ¬†You don‚Äôt care as much about any indi-vidual result and are instead interested in the aggregate results.

eg: If you launched two versions of your landing page and directed thousands of customers to each one to see which one had the higher conversion rate. then that would be a quantitative test.

Quant = what. how; Qual = why

Quantitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many‚Äù: what actions customers took and how many customers took an action (e.g.. clicked on the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button). But quantitative tests will not tell you why they chose to do so or why the other customers chose not to do so. In contrast. qualitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: the reasons behind different customers‚Äô decisions to take an action or not.

If you don't know where you're going. you might not get there
Objective Key-Result (OKR) is a framework of approaching a goal/project that ensures that you and your team make 1000s of decisions and steps. while being aligned on a common vision.

This blog will largely explore the key learnings I've gathered from this awesome book on the topic called "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. If you're curious. this person learnt the OKR framework from top management at Intel and replicated successfully. the same principles - at Google and grew the young startup at breakneck speed with people and products - whilst retaining the core vision of making information easily accessible to all.

The very 1st slide John showed to team Google said OKRS: "A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization"

I'll litter this blog with excerpts and stories that the book explored and I found most helpful.

OKR short intro
Objective is the WHAT is to bo achieved. These are significant. concrete. action oriented and ideally inspirational.

Key Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound. aggressive yet reliastic. Most of all they're measurable and reliable.

Where an objective can be long-lived. rolled over for a year or longer. key results evolve as the work progresses. Once the KRs are completed -> the objective is achieved

Thus. OKRs channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse ops. lending purpose and unity to the entire org. This is supremely important at startups or young companies where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction

The maker of OKR
Andy Grove. an Intel exec is credited for having created the management system of OKRs when Intel had taken up the responsibility of Operation Crush - a race to win in the 16-bit microprocessor market with their 8086 product in a time where cheaper and less performant products were eating market share.

It was the glorious story of how Intel dumped the business of memory-chip and went all-in on microprocessors and completely "crushed" every other contemporary compute company.

Here. are the 1st tenets of this system. by Dr. Grove himself:

Less is more
Set goals from the bottom up
No dictating
Stay flexible
Dare to fail

Great companies take the surplus cash flows created by their sustainable competitive advantages and then either return those to shareholders or reinvest those in their core franchise or - and this is the litmus test of greatness - reinvest those successfully in new activities or markets
"Unusual Billionaires". by Saurabh Mukherjea. is an unusually riveting & practical thesis. It is a collection of stories of brilliant companies that made their dent in the world by continuously innovating. providing great service. and building powerful teams & stable assets. It teaches us the unconventional yet core fundamental process of sustainably building great companies amidst this era of venture-backed rocketship dreams.

In this blog I'll be listing snippets from the book. that teach us all. the values of how great companies our built and share my thoughts on the same. ¬†In this market of the recession of fly-high crashes of crypto exchanges. the gloom of overpowering AI agents & plummeting stock prices. I think we can all take a page out of these learnings & realize how lasting services are created.

Asian paints
Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness. it turns out. is largely a matter of conscious choice. ~ Jim Collins (Good to great)
An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire ~ Yuval Nova Harari
A great company attracts the best talent. commands respect in the business community and. more often than not. trades at a premium in the stock market
Greatness is meant to be an enduring quality. Stock prices are an effect and not a cause of a company‚Äôs greatness
Metrics in a great company
Revenue growth of 10% and ROCE of 15% every year for non-financial services companies
Loan book growth of 15% and ROE of 15% every year for financial services companies
‚ÄúWe have consciously stuck to a sector which is growing and offers decent potential and have always strived for excellence across all functional areas. But it is not because somebody is observing us and is going to applaud us. We have just stuck to our knitting sensibly as the sector has evolved over decades - Jalaj Dani (promoter)
By obsessively using tech and talent to improve on internal processes and efficiencies. these companies put considerable distance between themselves and the competitions. In particular. this focus on efficiency and cost reduction helps the champion companies sustain high levels of profitability in a way that most of their rivals simply can‚Äôt match
Create and nurture an environment in which a multitude of talented minds work in harmony so that mutual competence is reinforcing rather than debilitating
IBAS framework - Innovation. Brands & rep. architecture. strategic assets
Innovation - shopkeeper would get 3.5% extra discount. if. without fail. he made payments on time throughout the year. adoption of computers & GPS
Brands & rep - Asian Paints changed their messaging to maintain an emotional connection with their target audience. Thus came the brand ambassador of a mischievous kid with a can of paint (name - ‚ÄúGattu‚Äù)
Architecture - Creating a truly independent board of directors to help shape evolution of the firm. Rapid career progression for those who perform with job rotation at reg. intervals.
Empowerment allows creativity. It‚Äôs about the feeling of being a family - Jalaj Dani
Strategic assets - sources of competitive advantages - intellectual property. licences. regulatory permissions. access to natural resources and natural monopolies
On the trust Asian paints built - ‚Äú50% of dealers won‚Äôt check their accounts. despite having access to a web portal which gives them real time updates on their accounts‚Äù
Berger
The most difficult thing to change at a company is to change its people

Don‚Äôt recruit someone who is not able to do a job. just to fill a vacancy. Secondly. even if we don‚Äôt have a job. but you come across the right person. you must recruit him

In FY13. talent and skill are increasingly becoming scarce and it requires considerable effort to identify. engage and retain such talents. The report also added that salary alone is not the criteria for satisfaction of deserving employees and that the firm needs to offer a participative work environment and an open culture

Marico
I strongly believe that culture can be a source of competitive advantage in an org and it is impossible to copy. The org‚Äôs culture is a major driving force in the execution of strategy. Correct culture helps in proper execution of strategy by helping everyone align on the same page (Mariwala)
A promoter supporting and listening to the board. although being a 60 percent shareholder. makes indep directors feel proud because we think that we are able to contribute to Marico. These things don‚Äôt reflect directly on the balance sheet. P&L or share price. but these are inputs which go into creation of long-term shareholder wealth
Page
Many companies justify risking balance sheet & profits for fueling growth. However. Page has maintained steadfast financial discipline whilst expanding its operations and at the same time. its share prices have also kept up an upward trend

The shift from people to processes was critical as the bank was moving away from reliance on corporate banking to retail banking (which needs very high use of data & analytics based decision making to grow the business whilst maintaining commercial viability
This operating structure makes the CEO of a pvt bank both less powerful than a promoter of a non-bank company but more influential than the CEO of a non-bank company (pg 209)
Employee policies are very consistent at Axis Bank and there is little ambiguity and subjectivity in the pay hikes and bonuses. All supervisors have to clearly explain the ratings they assign to their subordinates - something that decides pay rise. promotion & bonus. You won‚Äôt find this in other pvt sector banks. where a lot of randomness prevails in salary hikes. bonuses & promotions where lower rated employees have got higher bonuses

What is Back of the envelope?
A Back of the envelope calculation is a simple arithmetic operation frequently carried out on a little piece of paper. like an envelope. Back of the envelope analysis quickly generates a ballpark figure using approximated or rounded figures. An estimate is more accurate than a wild guess but less exact than a formal calculation using precise numbers in a spreadsheet or other program. These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.

In honor of physicist Enrico Fermi. back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.

In this article. we will talk about this methodology's history. applications. and best practices. Furthermore. I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations. Just a disclaimer - the calculations that are about to be added. are made with heavy assumptions - looking at Twitter 2.0 as a new service that we‚Äôll be building & basic components required for the same. The calculations don‚Äôt involve considerations of economies of scale. redundancy. replication and most estimations that involve scaling. We are just understanding a basic implementation of storage for the app. for the scale it is it


Twitter 2.0‚Äôs System Design diagram shared by Elon Musk in November 2022 - Source

Why are back of the envelope calculations needed?
The calculation generally informs us if the design can satisfy the functional requirements. such as the number of supported users. response latency. and resource needs. For instance. when deciding between different architectural designs. the simplest question to ask is whether one server is enough. To get a ballpark figure. we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require. if not one.

Notable Industry Applications
Some of the use cases where back of the envelope calculation has been used:

An important Internet protocol. the Border Gateway Protocol. was sketcBeforein 1989 by engineers on the back of "three ketchup-stained napkins". and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.
UTF-8. the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.
The Bailey bridge is a type of portable. pre-fabricated. truss bridge and was extensively used by British. Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.
The Laffer Curve. which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income. was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.
We've looked at some of the important historical applications of the back of the envelope. now we'll examine the arithmetic process to see how we can utilise it to solve our own issues. This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.

Getting Started with Back of the Envelope
Whenever we try to learn something new. we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly. when beginning system design estimations. we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers. used for estimating the speed of a system. are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency. as a term. helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example. the latency of the best video chat applications. such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.

How can we implement this?
Before approximating the real utilization. we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance. we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.

How can we guess the real usage?

The utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and. if necessary. further divided) and combined.

For instance. we might anticipate 1K active users. each of whom submits 15 requests daily.

15K requests per day. or 15K/86400 requests per second. are involved.

An effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly. Nobody likes to multiply by 86400. To give 0.2 seconds to serve a single request. let's round to 20K/100K. We need to set up at least 4 computers if we know that it takes 0.7 seconds to serve one request. Of course. you don't want to live on the edge. so let's increase the number of machines by a buffer and make it ten.

How to calculate quickly
If someone asked you to calculate: 2456000 x 4598; that would slow things down. wouldn‚Äôt it?

The simpler way to calculate quickly would be instead of spelling down a whole number. use small numbers paired with an abbreviation for magnitude (or. if necessary. exponents). 1K as opposed to 1000.

When given a huge. excessively exact number. such as 7432. immediately translate it to 7K. Anyhow. you are estimating.

This format for numbers makes multiplication and division quick.

KK is M. [K is Kilo; M is Mega]

G/M is K. [G is Giga]

4K7M = 28G.

Round both of them towards a small multiple of a power of 2 or 10 to work with larger numbers.

2714 ~= 3010 = 3000.
6500/250 ~= 6400/256 ~= 100 * 2^6 / 2^8 ~= 100 / 2^2 = 25.
Where to start Back of the envelope?
List the common use-cases of the system and decide which critical resources they require. You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start. but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?

Varied use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance. serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU. whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM. Since you need to purchase machines that are maxed out on both dimensions. hosting all those services on homogeneous machines would waste CPU and RAM.

Such differences indicate those features should be split to different services. hosted on independent sets of machines.

Real-world case study - Storage Costs borne by Twitter

Source

Problem: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements
Please note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers from Twitter.

Assumptions:

300 million monthly active users.
50% of users use Twitter daily.
Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
10% of tweets contain media.
Data is stored for 5 years.
Estimations:

Query per second (QPS) estimate:

Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000
Let‚Äôs start solving
There are 2 important queries that need to be addressed for any system:

‚ÄúRequests per second‚Äù at the server level
‚ÄúQueries per second‚Äù at the database level.
Let‚Äôs start with ‚Äúrequests per second‚Äù & what inputs are required to estimate its number

Users: Twitter has 300 million active MAUs. Not every user on Twitter is an active post-maker. 50% use daily - 150 million DAU
Usage per DAU: 10-25% make a tweet. Again. this doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; getting within an order of magnitude should be fine. Say each DAU. on average. makes 2 tweets: so 0.25%*2 = 0.5 tweets per DAU.
Scaling factor: Usage rate for a service has peaks & valleys throughout the day. Eg: The usage rate for your favorite e-commerce store or food delivery app will heavily increase in the case of discounts or sales in a particular festive season. We need to estimate how high the traffic would peak compared to the average. This would reflect the request per second peak where the design could potentially break. Most people tweet in the morning. so the tweet creation traffic is twice the average when US east coast wakes up.
Thus. total tweets in a day = 150 M DAU * (0.5 tweets/DAU) * (2x scaling factor in the morning)
Thus. requests per second = n/(number of seconds in a day) = n/86400 ~ 1500 tweets per second.
Let‚Äôs now look at how much storage is required for storing multimedia files for tweets.

150 million daily tweets. Say 10% of these tweets contain pictures of average size 300kB each & 1% of tweets contain videos of about 50MB each.
Let‚Äôs assume that the files are replicated with 3 copies each & atleast stored for 5 years.
Storage required for pictures = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.1 of tweets have images)* 300kB (image size) * 3copies = 13.5TB.
Storage required for videos per day = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.01 of tweets have videos) * (50MB video size) * 3copies ~ 225TB.
Total storage required for multimedia files per day = 238.5TB
Just the text for a tweet can be stored within 160B (i.e. 1280 bits ~ 160 characters per tweet on average)
Storage required for tweets per day = 150 M * (160B tweet size) * 3copies = 72GB
Let‚Äôs calculate overall storage cost for Twitter
Thus. we learnt that. for running Twitter. in the most basic sense. the following requirements must be met:

Assuming no data compression & our simple 3x replication. in the most basic form - 238.5TB blob storage required for storing all the multimedia of tweets that arrive in a day. 72 GB storage in database is required just for storing the basic tweet content.
Twitter was founded in 2006. However. it launched image sharing in 2011 & video sharing in 2013.
Thus. we can assume. that average storage required per day for videos uploaded by a growing user base can be our current estimate multiplied by a normalization factor of 0.6 (considering 15% of user growth on average. every year. since year of founding).
Thus. we have about (225TB video storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (9 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 443.5PB videos stored.
Similarly for image storage we have (13.5TB photo storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (11 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 32.52PB images stored
To store total multimedia for 11 years worth tweets. in the most fault tolerant & redundant manner. we need - 443.5+32.52 ~ 476.02PB (this figure is close to the actual ballpark around 500PB that Twitter has officially shared here)
Twitter uses AWS for storage of tweets & accompanying multimedia files. Say we use intelligent tiering by S3 to pay for data. that is most recent & popularly accessed. Other data. we can archive. & fetch on demand & pay for.
Estimating the media storage cost
476.02PB can be broken down into. say - 300 PB till 2019 (considering that video & images got introduced late) and 276PB after 2017.
Assuming the worst case pricing of S3 (the standard pricing) - All the multimedia of the last 3 years‚Äô tweets can be stored in S3 regular access & the other. can be stored in S3 archives (so we save cost) Thus. as per S3 pricing values. we end up paying:

For 300PB in archive: 308.073.20 USD monthly

For 276PB in regular tier: 5.935.645.70 USD monthly

Every year. our estimate of Twitter. pays 6.243.718.90 USD monthly. to store our images & videos.

Estimating the database cost for our tweets
Let‚Äôs use AWS relational database DynamoDB to store tweet data in a structured form - such as user info. tweet text. number of likes & retweets.
Twitter needs to store 72GB of tweets in a regular relational database. each day. to keep the lights on.
Again. estimating our normalization factor of 0.6 to aggregate tweet data. across 16 years since Twitter supporting text sharing right from the start. we get - (72 GB tweet data per day) *(365 days)* (16 years since tweeting was launched) * 0.6 = 252.28TB
Thus. using a standard on-demand DynamoDB (unoptimized for cost. but great for scale) - the storage cost comes to 603.355.92 USD monthly. to store our data.
For an actual analysis of all the databases Twitter uses. checkout this reference link
Here‚Äôs the actual AWS calculator cost estimation performed for this purpose.

Thus. this most basic. unoptimized design of that we made. pays 82.164.897.81 USD = 82 million USD every year to AWS. to keep providing its storage services only.

We have not even begun to discuss the computing costs. the data science costs in the cloud. Also. to keep this article a light read. we haven‚Äôt taken into consideration scalability solutions such as caching. multi-AZ databases and several aspects of storage itself.

Thus. you might now understand why Elon Musk is bent on optimizing this system a lot & even implementing the ‚ÄúDeep Cuts‚Äù plan to reduce infrastructure costs by a billion. But trying to fire 50% of the workforce and have the rest leave because the ship is sinking still doesn't make sense. To top it off. if your major problem is infrastructure cost you don't fire engineers. you task engineers to reduce infrastructure costs. Now. we may not agree or disagree with this logic. but atleast we‚Äôve learnt how to ballpark the financial element of the same.

Cheat Sheet for Back of the Envelope
We studied a way of estimating the storage cost borne by Twitter. But what about getting the speed of a video-game streaming platform? Or the requests per second of a payment gateway?

Fear not. here are a few important numbers that we can use to estimate useful metrics of any software system & what corresponding technical requirements it must be able to satisfy.

Example queue service limits - Pub/Sub ‚Äî limits. Kinesis ‚Äî limits. SQS ‚Äî limits

Scrapers - Requests: 1000 per second. Example scraper service - Colly ‚Äî go scraper

For estimating speed/latency of the system
These 14 latency numbers. revealed by Dr. Dean (Google). form the foundation of systems designing & performance optimization. Using these numbers we can predict how long it would take for a system to perform its computations. Refer to this website and the image below as a simple lookup for these numbers

What do we understand from this

Memory is fast. but the disk is slow.
Avoid disk seeks if possible.
Simple compression algorithms are fast.
Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible.
Data centers are usually in different regions. and it takes time to send data between them.
In a nutshell
A lot of back of the envelope calculations are done with just coefficients and exponents. e.g.. c‚àó10e. Your goal is to get within an order of magnitude right that‚Äôs just e. c matters a lot less.

What did we learn

Back of the envelope calculations allow you to take a look at different variations.
When designing your system. these are the kind of calculations you should do over and over in your head.
Know the back of the envelope numbers for the building blocks of your system. It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers. you have to know how your subsystems perform. You can't make decent back of the envelope calculations if you don't know what's happening.
Monitor and measure every part of your system so you can make these sorts of projections from real data.
I hope you understood how systems are operated in terms of estimating engineering infrastructure requirements. provisions & costing. What‚Äôs the one system that you want me to target next for back of the envelope analysis?

üí°
Tensor is a number/collection of numbers that maintains its meaning under transformations
üí°
More complex. but correct definition - An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules.
Each index of a tensor ranges over the number of dimensions of space. However. the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta).

Tensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices). vectors (that have exactly one index). and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.
Tensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity. fluid mechanics. and general relativity.
Beginner-friendly
Clearing the meaning. usage and confusions about tensors in ML and math
Tensors. a crucial concept in the field of machine learning. deep learning. and data science. often become a stumbling block for many learners. To fully grasp the idea. we'll break it down. explore examples. and demystify various related aspects such as rank. dimension. components. indices. size. and shape.

What are Tensors?
In simple terms. tensors are a generalization of scalars. vectors. and matrices. They can be seen as multidimensional arrays of numbers. with each dimension known as a rank.

A scalar is a single number. a tensor of rank 0.
A vector is an array of numbers. a tensor of rank 1.
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. a tensor of rank 2.
A 3D array. or a "cube" of numbers. is a tensor of rank 3.
The ranks continue to increase to define higher dimensional spaces.

Breaking Down the Definition of a Tensor
The formal definition of a tensor. "An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules." often overwhelms beginners. So. let's simplify it:

"nth-rank tensor": Rank refers to the number of dimensions or indices the tensor has. For example. a rank 1 tensor is a vector (which has one dimension). a rank 2 tensor is a matrix (which has two dimensions). and so on.
"m-dimensional space": This refers to the size of each dimension. For a matrix (rank 2 tensor). this would be the number of rows and columns.
"m^n components": Components are the individual elements or data points that make up the tensor. For example. in a matrix. each number is a component.
Simplifying with Examples
Consider a 3x3 image with three color channels (Red. Green. Blue). It is represented as a 3D array or a rank 3 tensor. with dimensions of 3 (height) x 3 (width) x 3 (color channels). It would have 3^3 or 27 components (individual color values for pixels).

Delving Deeper: Case of a 4x4 Image
Let's take a more specific example: a 4x4 pixel image with three color channels. Here. the tensor would have a rank of 3 (height. width. and color channels). The dimensions would be 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels). and there would be 4^3 or 64 components.

The indices here refer to the position of each component within the tensor. For example. you might reference the red color value of the pixel in the second row and third column as [2.3.1]. where '2' refers to the row. '3' refers to the column. and '1' refers to the red channel.

The size of this tensor would be calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions together. resulting in 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels) = 48. The shape of this tensor would be (4. 4. 3). describing the number of elements along each dimension.

Difference Between Rank and Dimension
While both terms describe the structure of a tensor. they represent different aspects. The rank is the number of dimensions. while the dimensions refer to the size (or length) of each of those dimensions. In the case of our 4x4 pixel image tensor. the rank is 3. and the dimensions are 4. 4. and 3.

Sample Log of a 4x4x3 Tensor
A 4x4 pixel image with three color channels can be represented as a 3D array (or rank 3 tensor). Each pixel's color is represented by a 3-element vector (for the three color channels). and the image consists of a 4x4 grid of such pixels. giving us a shape of (4. 4. 3).

A 4x4 pixel image with 3 color channels could be represented as a 4x4x3 tensor. like this:


tensor = [
    [  # First row of pixels

Clearing the Confusion Around "Dimension"
The term "dimension" can lead to some confusion. In the context of tensors. "dimension" often refers to the depth of nested lists. not the geometric or mathematical space that a vector might represent. So. a vector like [3. 4] is a rank-1 tensor (or one-dimensional array) because it involves no nesting of lists. Its shape is considered to be (2.) because it contains two elements.

In summary. tensors. while initially appearing complex. can be demystified and understood through the step-by-step breakdown of their components and properties. As multidimensional arrays. they provide the foundation for manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning. making them a fundamental concept for anyone delving into these fields.

Advanced
Exploring more properties of tensors
Understanding Covariance & Contravariance
A vector can be expressed in terms of its contravariant or covariant components

CASE 1: Expressing in terms of contravariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of components with basis vectors

üí°
We need 1 index for each of the components as there is only 1 directional indicator per component. 1 index. 1 basis vector. per component
If we decrease the length of the ‚Äúbasic vectors‚Äù (in a vector space). then the number of components required to make up a vector increases. Because the index & the number of components change contrary to each other. they are known as contravariant components of a vector Describing a vector in terms of these contravariant components (eg : 2 i + 3 j + 4 k) is how we usually describe a vectors


CASE 2: Expressing in terms of covariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of dot-product with basis vectorsIf we decrease the length of the basis vectors. then the dot-product decreases & vice versa. Since these properties are varying in the same way. we say that these are covariant components of a vector.


Specifying the notation for covariant & contravariant components


Now. say we take 2 vectors V & P

üí°
Index (for this rank 2 tensor. i.e. a vector) = unique combination of basis vectors
CASE 1: We multiply the contravariant values of V & P. On considering all possible ways. we get a matrix:

This will give us a tensor of rank 2 with 2 contra-variant index values. Here. each T value is called an element of this tensor. And since for each element. 2 indices (2 directional indicators are required) eg: Understanding by example. say we have a combination of 3 area vectors & 3 force vectors. To get the combination of all the forces on all the area vectors. for each such combination. we require 2 indices (i.e. 2 directional indicators ‚Üí 1 for the force & 1 for the area). We get 9 components. each with 2 indices (referring to 2 basis vectors)

What makes a tensor a tensor. is that. when the basis vectors change. the components of the tensor would change in the same manner as they would in one of these objects ‚Üí thus keeping the overall combination the same

What is it about the combination of components & basis vectors that makes tensors so powerful ‚Üí all observers in all reference frames agree. not on the components or the basis vectors ‚Üí but on their combinations. because they are the same

Index & Rank of tensors
üí°
Rank = the total number of indices = total number of coordinate systems (we need to have knowledge of to understand the location of the tensor) = total number of unique basis vector combinations = total number of unique linearly independent combinations = The total number of contravariant and covariant indices of a tensor.

The rank R of a tensor is independent of the number of dimensions N of the underlying space.
A tensor does not necessarily have to be created from vector components as is shown in these examples

A tensor of rank 1 is a ‚Äúvector‚Äù and has a number associated with each of the basis vectors. Only 1 index i.e. 1 combo of basis vectors is required to know the location


Here. \($V^1 = 5. V^2 = 3. V^3 = 2$\)


A tensor of rank 2 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 2 basis vectors


In a tensor of rank 3 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 3 basis vectors - composed of the components of 3 basis vectors. We can create different descriptions of this tensor by using different contravariant & covariant components of the basis vectors




More mathematical facts
While the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors. the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry. intended to represent physical space) . and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.
Objects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars. those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors. and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation. a vector v would be written $v_i$. where i=1. .... m. and matrix is a tensor of type (1.1). which would be written $a_i^j$ in tensor notation.
Tensors may be operated on by other tensors (such as metric tensors. the permutation tensor. or the Kronecker delta) or by tensor operators (such as the covariant derivative). The manipulation of tensor indices to produce identities or to simplify expressions is known as index gymnastics. which includes index lowering and index raising as special cases. These can be achieved through multiplication by a so-called metric tensor $g_{ij}. g^{ij}. g_i^j$. etc.. e.g..
Tensor notation can provide a very concise way of writing vector and more general identities. For example. in tensor notation. the dot product u¬∑v is simply written u¬∑v = $u_iv^i$ If two tensors A and B have the same rank and the same covariant and contravariant indices. then they can be added in the obvious way.
The generalization of the dot product applied to tensors is called tensor contraction. and consists of setting two unlike indices equal to each other and then summing using the Einstein summation convention. Various types of derivatives can be taken of tensors. the most common being the comma derivative and covariant derivative.
If the components of any tensor of any tensor rank vanish in one particular coordinate system. they vanish in all coordinate systems. A transformation of the variables of a tensor changes the tensor into another whose components are linear homogeneous functions of the components of the original tensor.
Tensors in the context of machine learning
The property of tensors to maintains its meaning under transformations is used also by machine learning. where real world data is transformed into corresponding tensors & then heavy calculations are done on these tensors to get valuable insights.

I used to just get so confused for understanding how do I actually incorporate a culture of powerful customer obsession that big companies like Amazon. Airbnb. Stripe speak so strongly about.

What does it mean? How does that change your workflow? What small optimizations can you do that can ensure you become such a company?

Yeah. you don't need a dedicated team for that - I want to list simple things you can do as a solopreneur in a garage as well.

Here's 4 learnings that I've had. from my current and previous startup. on how to build a reflex muscle for customer obsession. from 120+ overall interviews I've done.

0] an intro to the topic
Customer-centricity means you just know so much about the customer. that when you take decisions about product. you can tell exactly how your customers will react to it.

It's important because it builds very great relationship with them and they will stand by your team and product even when things don't work out that well.

1] 5hrs of talktime per week
If you're having less than 5hrs of talktime with customers. that means you either know everything about them or you need to find a different set of people to talk to. who're willing to spend time to discuss the problem.

Easy ways to get this:

Start by just asking your friends for people in their companies or families for a call and ask them to connect further. If you don't know anyone. just cold reachout your competitors' customers on Linkedin
Just ask for 25min calls. They seem shorter than 30 for some reason so I've seen people say yes and then give you the extra 5.
Ask them to not refer to "anyone". but "1 name" that they can think of - this is fast. and has 100% success rate.
Setup a communication channel on a platform they're most comfortable on. (Whatsapp. Telegram. Discord etc.) where you can just keep talking to them as friends
2] Less than a day of turnaround time
When you're a young company. you can provide near instanteneous customer support and that goes a long way in turning early adopters into evangelists. This is simple - just have them as priority notifications and swear you will reply something the moment you see a popup. Direct lines with founders who ping back quick feel very nice.

3] Organizing their feedback
This is the most important part. I'm sharing my company's template for this. It's just colorful stickies you can move around. but captures certain key snippets across multiple customers really well.

Just pick key sentences they say. tag and color them well - really helps a lot. Here's an example


At our company Recontact. we're helping people be amazing at building long-term relationships in professional and personal settings

Using this strategy. we figured out (check video) that "Maintenance" (i.e. keeping in touch with people) - was the most talked about point in our problem statement - because it had more stickies. And that realization saved us from spending 2 weeks worth of time in making "Search" in our app more efficient - because that's not what our customers cared about.

So yeah. that coloring and legend-making you did as a kid - well that's one of the key components in making a customer-centric business.

4] Building a muscle for the info
Revise. revise. revise. This. I learned from Apple CEO Tim Cook - who starts his day with reading random customer emails. Well. you can always read these stickies. Look into a simple analytics dashboard you can create for your app. - template link

You won't see it instantly. but. over time. a decision-making muscle gets built (very much like driving. music. fashion-sense) - that is very grounded in qualitative and quantitative analysis of customer feedback.

Listen to even the smallest details - you might not remember instantly. but then you'll be surprised how often you'll randomly remember a customer fact. when making a decision related to it.

In closing
You can be crazy passionate about this too - write customer snippets on your wall. listen to customer interviews at the gym. be thoughtful with delighting gifts. send personalized notes when their kids graduate etc. etc. etc.

Bottom line - Be close to the customer. even though the product will not work out. your company will. Business runs on trust and mutual respect.

"Social Capital" is simply the "network of relationships and acquantainces" that a person has developed over life".

We all hear fancy ass quotes about "making strong professional relations". "staying in touch with friends" and "your network is your net-worth". Here's a quick rundown of the best-selling way to build such social capital. since the past 80 years and beyond! Basically. become more likeable.

These are my key pointers from the book "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie. Each topic is its own tweetstorm - so kick back and read these wisdom snippets to help you build a strong people network.

With that let's dive in by understanding 6 ways to be a person who's good at making friends.

6 ways to make people like you
üí°
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
A dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love

You can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can. in 2 years. by trying to get other people interested in you

When you see a group photograph that you're in. whose picture do you look for first ?

It is the individual who is not interested in his/her fellow men/women who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring

You have to be interested in people if you wanna be a successful writer of stories

Can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them

eg : To call someone for an interview. write a letter first enclosing a list of questions that you except them to answer about themselves and their method of work

To find out someone's birthday ‚áí Begin by asking whether he/she believes the date of anyone's birth has anything to do with character or disposition

A show of interest. like every other human emotion. must be sincere

üí°
2. Smile
A smile says - "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you". That is why dogs make such a hit

A real smile. a heartwarming smile. a smile that comes from within. the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace

People who smile. tend to manage. teach and sell more effectively

Smile comes through in your voice

Hard work alone is the magic ¬†key that will unlock the door to our desires. People have succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. As the fun becomes work. people change ‚áí lose joy in it. leading business to grow dull and fail

Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Different mental attitude

Action seems to follow feeling but really. action and feeling go together and by regulating the action. which is under the more direct control of the will. we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not

Thus. the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there

Most folks are about as happy as they make up our minds to be

Picture in your mind. the able. earnest. useful person you desire to be and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual

A man/woman without a smiling face must not open a shop. It costs nothing but creates much

üí°
3. A person's name is to that person. the sweetest and most important sound in any language
The average person is more interested in his or her own name in all the other names on earth put together
Remember that name and call it easily. and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage
The executive who can't remember names can't remember a significant part of his/ her business and is operating on quicksand
Take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds
Most important ways of gaining good will is by remembering names and making people feel important
To recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion
To repeat the name several times during conversation and try to associate it with the person's features. expression and general appearance
Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices
Magic contained in a name should be realized as the single item. wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else.
The name sets the individual apart; it makes him/ her unique among all others
The info we are imparting or the request we are making takes on special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.
From the waitress to the senior executive herself. the name will work magic as we deal with others.
üí°
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention
Dale Carnegie on listening and responding ‚áí Hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise
Good conversationalists are merely good listeners who encourage a person to talk
"Yes. and" - pay attention and show indications of it from time to time with approval or disapproval.
Important personages crave a good listener but ordinary folk do too.
"Many a person call a doctor when all they want is an audience"
If you wanna know how to PREVENT making people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you. here is the recipe :
Always listen to anyone for long
Don't talk incessantly about yourself
If you have an idea while the other person is talking. wait for him/ her to finish
People who talk of themselves think only of themselves
Those people who think of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. no matter how instructed they may be
People you might be talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems
Therefore. if you aspire to be a good conversationalist. be an attentive listener
üí°
5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests
Theodore Roosevelt used to sit up late the night before. reading up on the subject in which he knew the guest is particularly interested in
Road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he/ she treasures most
The reward is an enlargement of life each time you speak to someone
üí°
6. Make the other person feel important ‚Äî and do it sincerely
If we are contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get somethin out of the other person in return ‚Äî we shall meet with the failure that we so richly deserve
Attain the feeling that you have done something for him/ her without his/ her being able to do anything in return for you
The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated ~ William James
Do unto others and you would have others do unto you
Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you". "Would you be so kind as to ‚Äî?". "Won't you please ?". "Would you mind". "Thank you ‚Äî" little courtesies like these. oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday and. incidentally. they are the hallmark of good breeding
The power of honest appreciation is stupendous as everyone considers themselves imp
Every person I meet is my superior in some way ¬†~Emerson
Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
In conclusion
Be interested. smile. remember their name. listen more. talk about their interests and make them feel important. You nail that and you find yourself as a likeable. good friend who is connected to a lot of different kinds of people very well.

This is going to be a super fast guide for developers to leverage platform development tools with VR and build cool apps. Starting with just a laptop and a Meta Quest in your hand.

Here's what the final thing looks like:


Code
Here's the GitHub Repo containing all the code - https://github.com/CMU-SV-Ronith/sem_3pi

Introduction to VR and AI-Generated NPCs
Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we interact with digital environments. offering immersive experiences that blur the lines between the virtual and real world. One of the most exciting advancements in VR is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). especially in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with users in more human-like ways. This blog post delves into the creation of an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. highlighting the technological synergy of VR and AI.

Choosing the Right Engine
When embarking on VR app development. selecting the right engine is crucial. Two prominent engines are Unity and Unreal. After extensive research and testing. Unity emerged as the preferable choice for several reasons:

Ease of Learning and Accessibility: Unity uses C#. known for its simpler syntax and automatic memory management. This choice makes Unity accessible. especially for beginners and indie developers. unlike Unreal Engine's complex C++.
Asset Store and Community Support: Unity boasts an expansive Asset Store. providing numerous resources that speed up development. Coupled with an active community. developers have access to extensive support and shared knowledge.
Versatility in 2D and 3D Development: Unity's proficiency in both 2D and 3D development offers flexibility. allowing developers to work on various project types without switching engines.
Platform Support and Integration: Unity's broad platform support. including PCs. consoles. mobile devices. and VR systems. is vital for developers targeting diverse audiences.
Strong Documentation and Educational Resources: Unity‚Äôs comprehensive documentation and learning resources are invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.
Making API Calls in C# with Code-Walkthrough
We code in C# in Unity. Here's a simple video on integrating Unity App with C# code that you write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgUIx75fJ_E

This was used for the Speech Analysis and Text Analysis functions.

To integrate AI into our VR app. we need to make API calls. This is achieved through UnityEngine.Networking. setting up coroutines for HTTP(s) communications. The process involves getting and posting information. waiting for responses. and updating the UI to reflect changes. We utilize AWS for backend services and the Dolby Media Speech Analytics API for speech analysis.

The AnalyzeText coroutine sends a user's transcript to our backend for processing. while GetAnalysisResults retrieves the analysis. The AnalyseSpeech coroutine sends audio files for speech analysis. and UploadFileToS3 handles the uploading of files to AWS S3.

                    Quality = responseJson.processed_region.audio.speech.details[0].quality_score.
                    LongestMonologue = responseJson.processed_region.audio.speech.details[0].longest_monologue
                };

            };

            var request = new UnityWebRequest(baseUrl + "/analyseSpeech". "POST")
            {
                uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonUtility.ToJson(requestJson))).
                downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer()
            };

            request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type". "application/json");
            request.SetRequestHeader("x-api-key". "YOUR_API_KEY"); // Replace with your actual API key

            yield return request.SendWebRequest();

            if (request.isNetworkError || request.isHttpError)

            var res = transcriptionTask.Result;
            StartCoroutine(AnalyzeText(res.Text));
        }
Creating NPCs with Inworld.ai and Trigger Words
NPCs are given life using tools like Inworld.ai. which allows for the creation of characters with specific goals and triggers. For instance. an NPC can be programmed to give a task when a user says a particular phrase. This adds an interactive layer to the VR experience. making it more engaging and realistic.

The code snippet for NPC interaction demonstrates how to set up these interactions. It includes setting up goals. defining trigger phrases. and programming responses and actions based on user interaction.

Reference video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVDoMnkw4rY

Complete Code and Overall Walkthrough
The complete code combines all these elements into a cohesive VR app. It demonstrates the integration of various APIs. handling of voice and text inputs. and interaction with NPCs. The code is structured to ensure seamless interaction within the VR environment. enabling users to experience a realistic and interactive AI interview.

This guide offers a window into the intricate process of developing an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. By combining Unity's versatile development environment with powerful APIs and AI-driven NPCs. developers can create engaging and immersive VR experiences. The future of VR and AI in app development is undoubtedly bright. offering endless possibilities for innovation and user engagement.

This article is a refresher to anyone looking to build in sales - the current approach. terminology. key insights. challenges and opportunities available in this domain.


What is a sales funnel?
A sales funnel is the marketing term for the journey potential customers go through on the way to purchase. There are several steps to a sales funnel. usually known as the top. middle. and bottom of the funnel. although these steps may vary depending on a company's sales model.

A basic sales funnel can be described as consisting of 4 levels. Marketers can take inspiration from this basic structure to design a sales funnel that suits the needs of their organisation.

Awareness: At the very top of the sales funnel is the awareness stage that is populated by the largest number of people. These people. not quite ready to be prospects yet. have just had their first interactions with your company and its offerings. They don‚Äôt know much about your brand at this stage. but are aware that it exists.
Interest: The first interactions will hook some of these newly-aware people and draw them slightly deeper into the funnel. With their interest piqued. these people will spend some time getting to know more about your company and your offerings. They might browse your website or catalogue. read your blogs. or peruse reviews from past customers.
Consideration: Armed with knowledge gathered during the interest stage. your prospects will double down on their efforts to know your company and offerings better. They may reach out to your customer service team with specific questions. or fill out a form to access more information. Remember. by this stage they may have already compared your offerings to those of your competitors. So. it is important to clearly answer their questions and help them understand how your offerings can solve their problems or needs.
Negotiation and decision: The prospect has now almost decided to purchase your product or service. Depending on the nature of your offerings. they might begin a negotiation over the price. terms of purchase. or both. But it‚Äôs fair to assume that they have a purchase intention at this stage.
At the end of this stage ‚Äîthe prospect and seller have negotiated the terms of the sale to their mutual satisfaction. and the prospect pays the seller to officially become a buyer.
Extra - Renewal or repurchase: The sale stage is not the end of the sales funnel. Soon a time will come when the sales contract is up for renewal. The customer must now decide if they want to continue with the same seller. If so. there might be a fresh round of negotiations over price and purchase terms. followed by a renewal or repurchase.

Here's an image of the currently most widely used Sales tools and the stage of the funnel they're utilized in:


Why is a sales funnel imp?
That‚Äôs the value of knowing a sales funnel: Successful sellers understand the journey a prospect is likely to take before they buy. and can make sure they‚Äôre ready to move on to each stage. They‚Äôre focused on the buyer. meeting their needs in the moment and building trust that helps move the deal forward.

So what if you ditched the sales funnel? You‚Äôd run the risk of focusing too much on the close to hit quota. pushing products or services when prospects aren‚Äôt ready. Win rates would drop because prospects wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the solutions they‚Äôre offered. and trust would be lost. No long-term relationships. no cross-sells. or upsells.

What challenges does sales have in 2023?
Challenge 1: Standing Out From the Competition
To differentiate from others. salespeople should exceed prospects' expectations by being well-versed in their CRM and sales software. and staying updated with industry trends and news.
Today. SaaS companies offer personalised email marketing. educational content. and in-depth exploratory calls with experienced representatives. Therefore. if you want to stand out from the crowd. you must be one step ahead of the already high standards of helpful. inbound selling.
Gather sales enablement materials like industry specific demos. case studies. reviews. testimonials. and analytics tools or reports.
Keep up with industry news. trends. and reports to help prospects guide strategy and show the potential ROI to their supervisors or other decision makers.
Set up alerts and automation to help you follow up with prospects at the right time and provide valuable resources.
Existing tools - Apollo.io. Outreach.io
Opportunity: This presents an opportunity to innovate in personalized and inbound selling.
Challenge 2: Meeting Quotas
A sales representative's best strategy for achieving quotas and converting leads is to make phone calls - whether they are selling remotely or not.
2. Two thirds of salespeople also use discounts and promotions. and more than half report that they increase sales. The most popular promotion among sellers is bundling a suite of products. followed by free trials.

Challenge 3: Getting in Direct Contact with Decision-Makers
With remote work becoming prevalent. establishing a strong social media presence. particularly on LinkedIn. is crucial for connecting with decision-makers.
In 2023. 67% of sales representatives worked under a hybrid or fully remote basis. and globally. almost 70% of professionals worked remotely. Many leaders and decision makers have physically moved to new locations farther away from their headquarters as industry events have largely shifted to virtual and hybrid formats.
It's crucial that salespeople establish their own presence on social media if they haven't already done so. LinkedIn was rated as the most effective platform for prospect research by nearly three quarters of sales professionals.
Challenge 4: Lack of High-Quality Leads
The first place to look when dealing with lead quality issues is sales and marketing alignment. Having a shared understanding of the ideal customer profile or buyer persona for sales and marketing teams is essential.
Assess the lifetime value of customers and which ones turn into promoters in order to develop and update these assets.
Using tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. HubSpot Sales Hub. LeadIQ. and others. sales teams find and engage with prospects at the right time after identifying target customers.
Challenge 5: Keeping Prospects Engaged Throughout the Sales Process
It is important to understand your buyer in terms of the bigger picture context so you can keep their interest throughout the sales process. which can be lengthy depending on the software package or service you are selling.
It is common for sales representatives to communicate with prospects two to seven times during B2B and B2C sales processes. which adds up when considering that most work with dozens of prospects at once.
The use of automated sales management tools and CRMs with lead intelligence and logging of communications with prospects (such as phone calls. emails. and actions) can help sales teams manage hundreds of data points to successfully acquire new customers.
Challenge 6: Difficulty Getting Meetings With Prospects
Timing is everything. Reach out at the wrong time. you‚Äôre a nuisance. Reach out at the right time. and you‚Äôre the answer to a prayer. It‚Äôs well known in the industry that the best salespeople spend most of their time on calls with prospects listening.
In order to secure meetings with qualified prospects. the best strategy is to listen. And to make it easy to meet with you. When listening for signals that a prospect is ready to meet. use these questions as a guide:
Social selling requires a combination of social media savvy and sales tools that can automatically flag key readiness indicators and send automatic alerts.
Key insights from 30+ interviews with sales and growth teams
Over the past 3 weeks. with conversations over 30 sales people. here are the key insights that stood out from my learnings in the current approach:

Efficiency in Data Management: Many use tools like Excel and Salesforce for data organization. but there's a challenge in maintaining data hygiene and integrating personal notes effectively.
Personalized Customer Engagement: Sales reps emphasize personalized interactions. like remembering personal details about clients and customizing outreach. This includes tactics like social media engagement. client lunches. and gift-giving.
Utilization of Digital Tools: Sales teams heavily rely on digital tools like CRM systems. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. and calendar reminders for tracking client interactions and industry news.
Challenges with Remote and Hybrid Sales: Adapting to remote and hybrid sales environments is a notable challenge. affecting how sales reps connect with decision-makers and clients.
Importance of Relationship Building: There's a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships. seen as crucial in high-value sales.
Adapting to Market and Client Dynamics: Sales reps must adapt to changing client personnel and market conditions.
Efficient Use of Time and Resources: Balancing time spent on tasks like data entry and client engagement is crucial. especially in cold outreach and event networking.
Conclusion
In summary. the sales funnel remains a vital concept in the sales process. guiding potential customers from awareness to purchase.

In 2023. sales teams face challenges like standing out from the competition. meeting quotas. and effectively engaging with decision-makers. particularly in remote and hybrid work environments.

Utilizing digital tools like CRMs and LinkedIn. focusing on personalized customer engagement. and maintaining efficient data management are essential strategies. Building strong relationships and adapting to market dynamics are key to navigating these challenges.

This blog is from notes from an amazing talk at the OpenAI DevDay conference by Colin Jarvis and John Allard. Here's the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y)
In the realm of natural language processing. optimizing large language models (LLMs) is a formidable challenge. Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity. The performance of LLMs. often abstract and difficult to measure. requires a nuanced approach to optimization. In this blog. we‚Äôll explore a mental model of options for LLM optimization and develop an appreciation for which option to use and when.

You will leave with a foundational understanding of the two axes of optimization‚Äîcontext and LLM behavior‚Äîas well as a practical guide to the nuanced world of model refinement.

The Twin Axes of Optimization

1. Context Optimization
At its core. context optimization is about fine-tuning what the model needs to know. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:

Prompt Engineering: As the lower-left quadrant in our optimization matrix. prompt engineering is your fast lane to setting a baseline. Start by refining the prompts you feed into the LLM and observe the performance changes.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Positioned in the upper-left. RAG introduces more context. Begin with simple retrieval mechanisms. and consider fine-tuning for a more nuanced approach.
2. LLM Behavior Optimization
LLM behavior optimization delves into how the model should act. The two main strategies are:

Fine-tuning: The lower-right quadrant represents fine-tuning. which customizes the LLM‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks.
Comprehensive Approach: Sometimes. a combination of all methods is required to reach the desired performance level. An example would be integrating HyDE retrieval with a fact-checking step.
The key is to start somewhere. evaluate. and then iterate with another method.

Strategies Explored
Prompt Engineering: The Starting Block
Starting with clear. concise instructions and breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks is paramount. Giving models "time to think" and testing changes systematically can yield surprising improvements. Extending this by providing reference text and using external tools can further enhance the results.


When It Shines:

Quick testing and learning
Establishing a baseline for further optimization
Its Limitations:

Introducing new information
Replicating complex styles or methodologies

Retrieval Augmented Generation: Expanding Knowledge
By giving LLMs access to domain-specific content. RAG helps update the model's knowledge and control the content it generates to reduce inaccuracies.


When It Shines:

Introducing new. specific information
Controlling content to reduce errors
Its Limitations:

Broad domain understanding
Learning new languages. formats. or styles
Enhancing RAG:

Employ retrieval with cosine similarity and HyDE
Experiment with FT embeddings and chunking
Implement reranking and classification steps
Evaluating RAG:

On the LLM side. consider the faithfulness and relevance of the answers.
On the content side. assess the precision and recall of the context retrieved. More data does not necessarily equate to higher accuracy.

Fine-tuning: The Custom Tailor
When prompt engineering doesn't cut it. fine-tuning may be the right path. Continuing the training process with domain-specific data can optimize model performance and efficiency. For example. Canva leveraged fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to produce structured output. showcasing the power of high-quality training data.


When It Shines:

Emphasizing existing knowledge
Customizing response structure or tone
Its Limitations:

Injecting new knowledge into the model
Quick iterations on new use-cases
Steps to Fine-tune:

Data preparation
Hyperparameter selection and loss function understanding during training
Evaluation with relevant test sets and expert opinion
Fine-tuning Best Practices:

Start with prompt engineering
Establish a clear baseline
Prioritize quality over quantity in training data

The Combined Approach: Fine-tuning + RAG
Sometimes. a blend of fine-tuning and RAG yields the best results. This method allows the model to understand complex instructions with minimal tokens. creating more space for retrieved context and leading to a more robust performance.




Practical Application
The real-world application of these strategies can be as creative as generating hypothetical answers to enhance similarity searches. For example. initial baselines might yield a 69% performance rate. while a RAG with a well-crafted answer could increase that to 84%. comparable to fine-tuning. Collaborations. such as the one between Scale AI and OpenAI. demonstrate how a combined approach can optimize models to new heights of efficiency and effectiveness.


Careful what you fine-tune on
In conclusion. maximizing LLM performance isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It requires a toolkit of strategies‚Äîfrom prompt engineering to fine-tuning and beyond‚Äîeach with its own set of benefits and best-use scenarios.

there needs to be a part of education that allows students to dream and tinker and take risks. Something that makes them laugh and cry and hope and bond and stay up late in teams and chase self-assigned deadlines and ship something they would have never thought they could.

that was the ideal of buildschool.

we wanted to give students "an ecosystem of believer-builders who built things to solve problems because they wanted to". and having friends around always helps.

but the issue was. we were targeting a student base who had just come back from remote learning. who was not entirely immersed into this tinkering culture and was more driven by definite career paths.

in April 2022. Technical Society (TechSoc) started with minimal funding. full motivation and targeted growth hacks. to grow a strong community. I think the best takebacks from this journey are perseverence. dealing with ambiguity. and faith in the dreamers of tomorrow.

and our approach at TechSoc has always been - invest in the team. invest in the participants and invest in the future. here's 3 stages of how we built a community from scratch and run it well. to this day.

üí°
This journey was only possible due to the amazing contribution by Anouksha Hemanth. Prabhat Bedida. Subham Sagar. Yashaswi. Piyush Agrawal. Nikshay Jain. Vishwajeet. GK Harish and several others who made this vision real.¬†
building a team
first. we had to make team buildschool believe that the mission they were solving was important because they would be enablers of a movement much bigger than themselves. so Anouksha and me used YCombinator's startup school curriculum and actually had each manager at buildschool study startup from a perspective of product strategy. history. revenue and future steps. this helped them understand how products are built. gain confidence in talking more about these ideas and also be better thinkers in general. over 2.5 months we did multiple startup teardowns. had these people practice cold emailing founders and speaking comfortably with them. here are some of their early day case studies.

once our little army was ready. it was time to go to war. boy. was it going to be brutal.

inspiring a community
the early days were very random and we had barely any clue of processes and contacts and pretty much anything. we were just very clear on what we had to solve - get 10 student prototypes. not powerpoints. out by the next 13 weeks.

to begin with. the issue was. how do you even get people to care to solve problems? it was always cooler to do fancy PoRs that add sure-shot resume points as opposed to taking a bet on whether you and your buddies could build something or not

and even if people do care. how do you get them to actually learn this process of product building - right from design. to shipping to release to iteration and beyond? well. the answer actually lies in inspiring people.

as Simon Sinek says. if you connect with the "why" of people. you can truly move them to do unbelievable things. and we did all sorts of crazy things to get the message across. here's a video from the early days. just a whiteboard. an ai generated thumbnail and some students talking about a crazy vision of 10 teams. 10 weeks. 10 prototypes.


we did speak to people and touch upon a nerve.

to further this. we revived the history of the "fun in building" through our alumnus Kedar Kulkarni - who started off with very realistic stories of moving up the quality ladder by building computer vision fun-tools with his friends and then moving up to govt partnerships and funded projects. looking back. i think that may have struck a really strong chord - even in me.


something to remind students of where the foundation of innovation lies
sustaining the experience
10 teams selected. basic application on their plan for 10 weeks. we were just looking for grit.

to refine our teams. buildschool organized really amazing talks right from product research and UI designing. all the way up to engineering and growth post launch. we got CXOs and industry veterans to give talks for free - how did we do that? well. we just connected with the "why" of these disruptors through a cold email as simple as:


the thing that sold best was the thought of inspiring students to build more
boom! 7 high quality lectures in various domains - all conducted at zero cost. well. except for the food. it does not have to be complex - ¬†

growth hack - give people free food and they show up the 1st time. give them a memorable experience and they will keep showing up again and again.


give them pizza and they'll do amazing things
and it was hard. students want to do all sorts of things at all times. so we used accountability partners called "build buds" for each team to navigate through getting the right resources. connected to the right folks. and even actually finishing right before deadlines.

guess what - at a mini demo day amongst the teams - 9 of them had a functioning product! here's a random picture from the mini demo day at the 8 week mark.

investing in the future
by the time the 10th week ended. teams had transformed beyond what we had thought. people who didn't know coding had built apps. people who were shy on stage were presenting. people who were unsure about their passions had picked up something new and built something meaningful out of it. well. and the buildschool team - they had gone through the extreme rollercoaster of 0 attendee events (that really happened. it was really stressful) to having a great turnout of 9 products built in those 10 weeks and then we came for a repeat in the upcoming semesters with even more student interest. what makes me smile the most. is that people actually now think of this as a thing they can do full time.


end of buildsprint #1. november 2022
fun fact. one team even got incubated in the startup accelerator at IIT Madras. i look forward to more such stories.

‚≠êÔ∏è here's my takeaway - atleast once in life. i feel. every person must go through the pain and the fulfilment of building something from 0 to 1. because once you're on the other side of the storm - you gain the self-confidence to do anything you want.

that's what our vision at techsoc always has been. cheers and happy building!

Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart is a fantastic tool to deploy machine learning models. In this blog. we'll walk you through the process of using Jumpstart to deploy a model named "Llama2" and expose it as an API endpoint using AWS Lambda functions.

Step 1: Set Up SageMaker Domain and User
Begin by navigating to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Console. Here. create a domain and user profile. This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.

Step 2a: Deploy the Llama2 Model
After setting up your domain and user. head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the "Sagemaker Jumpstart" section. and from there. choose to deploy the "llama 7b model." This process usually takes about seven minutes. and at the end of it. you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this. as it will be essential for the next steps.

Step 2b: Integrating any Huggingface Model with Amazon Sagemaker
Instead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options. you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how

1. Setup development environment
We are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.

import sagemaker
import boto3
sess = sagemaker.Session()
# sagemaker session bucket -> used for uploading data. models and logs
# sagemaker will automatically create this bucket if it not exists
sagemaker_session_bucket=None
if sagemaker_session_bucket is None and sess is not None:
    # set to default bucket if a bucket name is not given
    sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()

    
    
def setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=None):
    """
    Params:
    - default_bucket: Default bucket name to use for the session

    Returns:
    - session: SageMaker session object
    - role_arn: ARN of the IAM execution role
    """
    global sagemaker_execution_role
    session = sagemaker.Session(default_bucket=default_bucket)

    try:
        sagemaker_execution_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
    except ValueError:
        iam = boto3.client('iam')
        sagemaker_execution_role = iam.get_role(RoleName="sagemaker_execution_role")['Role']['Arn']

    return session. sagemaker_execution_role

def mask_account_id(account_id):
    return '*' * len(account_id)

def main():
    sagemaker_session_bucket = None

    session. sagemaker_execution_role = setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=sagemaker_session_bucket)

    # Mask it
    account_id = sagemaker_execution_role.split(':')[4]
    masked_account_id = mask_account_id(account_id)
    masked_role = sagemaker_execution_role.replace(account_id. masked_account_id)

    print(f"SageMaker role ARN: {masked_role}")
    print(f"SageMaker session region: {session.boto_region_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC
Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker. we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend. session. region. and version. You can find the available versions here

from sagemaker.huggingface import get_huggingface_llm_image_uri


## Fetch docker image URI for the Hugging Face DLC:
# 1. backend name
# 2. Hugging face LDC version


# retrieve the llm image uri
llm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri(
  "huggingface".
  version="0.9.3"
)

# print ecr image uri
print(f"llm image uri: {llm_image}")

Hardware Requirements
Llama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B. 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.

Note: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.

MODEL	INSTANCE TYPE	QUANTIZATION	# OF GPUS PER REPLICA
Llama 7B	(ml.)g5.2xlarge	-	1
Llama 13B	(ml.)g5.12xlarge	-	4
Llama 70B	(ml.)g5.48xlarge	bitsandbytes	8
Llama 70B	(ml.)p4d.24xlarge	-	8
Note: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning. e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.

These are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B. 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks. we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances. since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.

It might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.

# confirm requirements met for kernel
import json

def get_instance_type_from_metadata():
    with open('/opt/ml/metadata/resource-metadata.json') as f:
        metadata = json.load(f)
        resource_name = metadata.get('ResourceName'. '')
    return resource_name

def main():
    resource_name = get_instance_type_from_metadata()

    # List valid instance types
    valid_instance_types = ['ml.g5.12xlarge'. 'ml.g5-48xlarge']

    if any(instance_type in resource_name for instance_type in valid_instance_types):
        print("Instance configured correctly")
    else:
        print("Need to upgrade to at least 'ml.g5.12xlarge' instance")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
4. Deploy Llama2 to Amazon Sagemaker
To deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id. instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type. which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.

Note: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.

import json
import getpass
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel


def get_sagemaker_config():
    # sagemaker config
    instance_type = "ml.p4d.24xlarge"
    number_of_gpu = 8
    health_check_timeout = 300

    # Define Model and Endpoint configuration parameter
    config = {
      'HF_MODEL_ID': "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf". # model_id from hf.co/models
      'SM_NUM_GPUS': json.dumps(number_of_gpu). # Number of GPU used per replica
      'MAX_INPUT_LENGTH': json.dumps(2048).  # Max length of input text
      'MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(4096).  # Max length of the generation (including input text)
      'MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(8192).  # Limits the number of tokens that can be processed in parallel during the generation
      'HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN': getpass.getpass("Enter your Hugging Face hub token")
      # .'HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE': "bitsandbytes". # comment in to quantize
    }
    return instance_type. health_check_timeout. config

def create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. image_uri):
    # check if token is set
    assert config['HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN'] != "". "Please set your Hugging Face Hub token"

    # create HuggingFaceModel with the image uri
    llm_model = HuggingFaceModel(
      role=role.
      image_uri=llm_image.
      env=config
    )
    return llm_model


def main():
    instance_type. health_check_timeout. config = get_sagemaker_config()
    
    # Set role and image_uri
    role = sagemaker_execution_role
    llm_image_to_ref = llm_image
    
    # Declare llm model with create_hugging_face_model module
    llm_model = create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. llm_image_to_ref)
    
    # Deploy model to the endpoint if llm_model is available
    if llm_model:
            llm = llm_model.deploy(
                initial_instance_count = 1.
                instance_type=instance_type.
                container_startup_health_check_timeout=health_check_timeout
            )
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
5. Run inference and chat with the model
5. Run inference and chat with the model
After our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:

temperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.
max_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20. max value is 512.
repetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. defaults to null.
seed: The seed to use for random generation. default is null.
stop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.
top_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null. which disables top-k-filtering.
top_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling. default to null.
do_sample: Whether or not to use sampling ; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.
best_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs. default to null.
details: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.
return_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.
truncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.
typical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.
watermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.
You can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation

The meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:

[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>

{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]

We create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt. which converts a List of "messages" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.

def build_llama2_prompt(messages):
    startPrompt = "<s>[INST] "
    endPrompt = " [/INST]"
    conversation = []
    for index. message in enumerate(messages):
        if message["role"] == "system" and index == 0:
            conversation.append(f"<<SYS>>\n{message['content']}\n<</SYS>>\n\n")
        elif message["role"] == "user":
            conversation.append(message["content"].strip())
        else:
            conversation.append(f" [/INST] {message['content'].strip()} </s><s>[INST] ")

    return startPrompt + "".join(conversation) + endPrompt
  
messages = [
  { "role": "system"."content": "You are a friendly and knowledgeable vacation planning assistant named Clara. Your goal is to have natural conversations with users to help them plan their perfect vacation. "}
]
# define question and add to messages
instruction = "What are some cool ideas to do in the summer?"
messages.append({"role": "user". "content": instruction})
prompt = build_llama2_prompt(messages)

chat = llm.predict({"inputs":prompt})

print(chat[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Now we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.

# hyperparameters for llm
payload = {
  "inputs":  prompt.
  "parameters": {
    "do_sample": True.
    "top_p": 0.6.
    "temperature": 0.9.
    "top_k": 50.
    "max_new_tokens": 512.
    "repetition_penalty": 1.03.
    "stop": ["</s>"]
  }
}


# send request to endpoint
response = llm.predict(payload)

print(response[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Step 3: Integrate with AWS Lambda
With your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand. navigate to AWS Lambda. Here. create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:

import json
import boto3

ENDPOINT_NAME="jumpstart-dft-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b"
runtime= boto3.client('runtime.sagemaker')

def lambda_handler(event. context):
    data = event["body"]
    print(data)
    
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME.
        ContentType='application/json'.
        Body=data.
        CustomAttributes="accept_eula=true"
    )
    
    response_content = response['Body'].read().decode()
    result = json.loads(response_content)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200.
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }
Step 4: Grant Necessary Permissions
For your Lambda function to work correctly. it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions. create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17".
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0".
      "Effect": "Allow".
      "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint".
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Step 5: Expose Lambda Function as an API
Once your function is ready and permissions are in place. expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.

Step 6: Testing Your Deployment
To test the setup. use a curl command. like the one below:

curl --location 'https://khhg37edhrmibhj4ahsxqnqlha0qoqqc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "inputs":"I believe the meaning of life is".
    "parameters":{
        "max_new_tokens":256.
        "top_p":0.9.
        "temperature":0.6
    }
}'
This command sends a POST request to your Lambda function. which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.

In Conclusion
Setting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process. It offers scalability and ease of integration. making it suitable for a range of applications. For more detailed steps and best practices. you can refer to this official AWS blog.

Futurecasting. - or the art of envisioning the unforeseen. is a crucial skill in our dynamic world where the tide of events can shift unpredictably. Our perception plays a pivotal role in determining how we steer our ship into the future.

Mental Maps and Perceptions
As individuals. we need to acknowledge that our understanding of the future is inevitably tinted by personal perceptions and biases. not objective truths. Each person's mental map. the internal framework we use to navigate decisions. varies. and these maps significantly influence the decisions made regarding the future.

The Risk of Success
Ironically. success might be one of our biggest stumbling blocks. Past triumphs can make us overly reliant on the mental maps that brought us to our current position. A strategy that yielded success in the past isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work indefinitely. and overconfidence in these tried-and-tested mental maps might blind us to other possibilities and opportunities.

The Pitfall of Incorrect Maps
As the legend goes. the first set of Spanish voyagers actually thought that there was a water body connecting south-west and north-west coast of USA. And they made a wrong map. with full confidence. not knowing their mistake. Fun fact. until 16 years. voyagers used the wrong map and after multiple complaints. they were finally able to break the mental model of the government to actually update the map. And that process took 160 years total. The story of the erroneous map of the USA. used for 160 years due to stubborn belief in its accuracy. serves as a telling example. An incorrect understanding leads to misguided actions. and once a particular map (or belief) is accepted. altering it becomes a formidable challenge.

Asking Uncomfortable Questions
Futurecasting is not about comfort; it's about preparedness and openness to disquieting truths. It requires us to challenge our convictions and ask questions that make us squirm. This process involves thinking divergently about what lies ahead. questioning the mental maps we hold dear. and being willing to redraw them as needed.

Navigating with Awareness
Much like skilled sailors navigating the waters with an acute awareness of tides and winds. individuals and organizations need to craft strategies with a deep understanding of global currents and shifts. Where you eventually land is a result of both your goals and the global factors that either facilitate or hinder your journey.

Case in Point: The Oil Business

A look at the oil industry. where success is traditionally measured by rig count. reveals a critical mistake. Businesses often take one scenario. tweak it slightly. and convince themselves that they are working with different models. However. slight variations of a single view do not capture the diversity and unpredictability of the real world.

Learning from IBM

A picture from forecasting by an IBM leader. saying that PCs weren't a good enough market
IBM‚Äôs monumental miscalculation of the PC market potential‚Äîestimated at a few hundred thousand dollars. while the real value was a staggering $30 million‚Äîcost them dearly. The mental maps of their strategists. albeit successful in the past. failed to envision a scenario where PCs would be ubiquitous. missing out on a colossal opportunity and leaving an estimated $200 billion on the table - $100 billion for the software OS (Windows. then called MS-DOS) and $100 billion for the chip making market (that Intel captured)

Scenario Thinking: An Essential Tool
To prevent these decision traps. scenario thinking is invaluable. It helps to mitigate overconfidence. encourages outside-in thinking. enables seeing the full picture. corrects problem framing. and promotes asking the right questions. The goal is not to predict the future accurately but to ask better. more insightful questions. to prepare for a variety of possible futures.


Conclusion
Futurecasting. therefore. is a dance between confidence and humility. knowledge and curiosity. planning and flexibility. It's about continually asking "what if" and being prepared to redraw your mental maps to navigate the thrilling. unpredictable. and often unthinkable tides of the future. Let's escape the confines of our minds and be open to the vast. exciting possibilities the future holds.

Checkout this comprehensive analysis of various stakeholders. factors and strategic outcomes - link

If the very essence of employability is threatened then isn‚Äôt it important to talk about it?
And this time it is different. We talk about how technology shifts have been there. but this time its different. Today there are 78 million jobs that are vulnerable to be automated (IMF Report. 2021). And not enough non-routine. cognitive jobs being created (62mill) to fill this unemployment. gap(IMF Report. 2021). And lets take today‚Äôs discussion to talk about how this unfair wealth battlefield can be given its justice. It is currently important to study how this divide is ‚Äúcreated strongly due to technology‚Äôs impact on employability‚Äù.at this point time - and prepare ourselves for an ambiguous future

1. Job Displacement due to Automation
Automation has pierced through not just manufacturing sectors. but a vast array of industries. radically transforming the employment landscape. Far from being limited to routine and repetitive tasks. modern technological tools are expanding into spaces we once believed were uniquely human: content generation. graphic design. music composition. and even video editing.

Data Snapshot: Forecasts warn that a staggering 800 million workers worldwide could find their roles obsolete by 2030 due to automation. Furthermore. an alarming statistic states that 60% of all occupations have at least 30% of tasks that can be automated. signifying the breadth of the potential impact.
2. The Daunting Skills Gap
The velocity at which technology is advancing presents a conundrum. On one end. there's a surge in tech-centric roles. while on the other. there's a glaring skills deficit. This gap is even more pronounced among certain demographics: the elderly. individuals in rural settings. those encumbered by responsibilities. people with disabilities. immigrants. refugees. and professionals in non-tech domains.

Data Snapshot: The World Bank's 2020 report on the digital economy illuminated the magnitude of this disparity. noting that a mere 1% of Africa's workforce possesses ICT skills. Moreover. Deloitte's findings underline this crisis. with 64% of employees believing their organizations are unprepared to bridge this skills chasm. Adding fuel to the fire. only 17% of institutions are confident about having a future-ready workforce.
3. Escalating Income Inequality
The technological boom has inadvertently created a rift between high-skilled tech aficionados and low-skilled workers. As the former group reaps the benefits of a tech-driven economy. the latter. especially those susceptible to automation. grapples with stagnating or diminishing wages.

Data Snapshot: As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. the wage gap between those armed with a college degree and those with just a high school education has been expanding. The United Nations' ITU highlights another facet. pointing out that a lack of access to digital tools and the internet exacerbates income inequality.
4. Concentration of Wealth: The Tech Elites
It's undeniable that the tech era has given birth to a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals. This isn't just about riches but also the power and influence that come with such immense wealth. from influencing political decisions to shaping economic policies.

Data Snapshot: 2021 data reveals that the collective wealth of global billionaires skyrocketed to over $10 trillion. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. the ten wealthiest individuals added a colossal $450 billion to their coffers. To put this disparity into perspective. the top 1% of the global populace controls more than 44% of the world's wealth.
5. Gig Economy: Freedom or Feudalism?
The gig economy. bolstered by technology. promises flexibility and autonomy. Yet. it's essential to ponder whether it's a genuine avenue for empowerment or merely a modern form of feudalism. where workers. despite being 'connected'. remain isolated and vulnerable.

Data Snapshot: The gig ecosystem has witnessed explosive growth. with 36% of the U.S. workforce engaged in gig roles. cumulatively contributing to a market valued at $204 billion.
In synthesizing these insights. the digital age emerges as a paradox. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. it simultaneously casts shadows of inequality and uncertainty. As we navigate this era. it's paramount that stakeholders ‚Äì from governments to corporations to educators ‚Äì work in tandem to ensure that the digital future is inclusive. equitable. and just.

16 AUG 2023 ‚Ä¢ 11 MIN READ

I did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software. This blog would be the story and the specifics of what a lot of people have asked me over the years. about how I made the switch and some things that you can use too. if you're interested in the same

I'll keep a major part of this blog very generic to the topic "switching streams" in general and then I'll add a section. at the end. about things I did.

Continuous learning is the name of the game
Today. learning anything is completely possible. at any given point. if you're willing to put in the work.

A lot of times we're under the notion that only a few people can learn a skillset based on the course they're "officially" enrolled in or some background experience they've had. I don't believe so. I think. that in this all-knowing YouTube and ever-improving-chatGPT era - anyone can learn anything from the Internet - for free. at their pace and convenience and from tonnes of world leading tutors.

Here are some pointers that might help you:

There is no magical playbook - to learn anything. it takes a lot of time and persistent effort of finding the right material for yourself and creating a roadmap for improving in the skill. So it's fine if you're not having a clear path to start with. There are a couple of channels that can give a clear path. but I think. that just starting from a Google or YouTube search about the topic name is a good place to start.
Taking notes really helps - Even if it's rough screenshots. scribbling random thoughts while learning or just copy-paste's of youtube videos - it works. I'm currently exploring YouTube video summarizer plugin in ChatGPT for this purpose. What's even better is revising and refining notes - for smarter reference later. It's like creating a power pellet from your learnings that you can consume at any point in the future to catch up on the skill super-fast. I used Notion for organizing whatever I've learnt into easily reference-able notes.
Motivation is 2/3rds of the game - Dedicate a fixed time slot for learning and keep struggling to make the most of it. Have very little ego. Initially you might suck - that's cool. But after breaking your head for about 1-2months. you'll not even realize but you'll naturally start seeing patterns and connections. That's the next level.
You shouldn't be afraid to suck at something new and give up if you struggle across even when understanding a paragraph of a new topic. Hell. when I was learning programming. it took me about 12hours to fully grasp and implement a 5 min youtube video about animation. But then. relentlessly pursuing on and on and on. I was able to condense 12 hr worth learnings into 5mins of revision through my notes. It's going to be hard. but if you just stick with it. it's going to be worth it.

The world is project-driven
We live in a fast paced world where most teams just look for how much value an individual can add to their team. If you've independently taught yourself and built impactful projects. no one really cares about your background coming from.

This can be harvested well to your benefit if you want to even your odds with those. who are already in the stream you like. Just build projects that rival with them. And these days YouTube has walkthroughs of any project across any stream for free - it's just so good.

Here are some key pointers to help you in this leg:

Projects are strong applications of learning - Project can mean anything - a tiny robot. a sketch. a basic app. a research paper commentary. a spreadsheet. ¬†a 5sec musical composition. a youtube video - anything. Point is - you're supposed ¬†to have employed your learnings and you're supposed to have worked super hard. It will help grasp the reason of each thing you thought was dumb but you read anyways and help translate it into moving parts of something very impactful
Start by copying other people's work - A good place to start is searching for existing projects on the internet and interpreting and recreating their work. Painters. musicians. writers. chefs - do it all the time while practicing - just patiently learning from the experience of others. This would help avoid pitfalls and learn best practices from your teachers. Again - don't just blind copy as they do. Refer - understand - try to recreate - fail - go back to refer- then understand - then try to recreate and so on.
Add your own flavor to each project - Employ a personalized touch to your project so that its unique. In the early days. I liked reading so when I came to programming projects - I would just add quotes of my favourite personalities in them as my touch. Now for you. it can be anything you like. but once you do this. you just differentiate extremely well from every other person who's just blind-copying and give a polished overall outcome
Tie the project to your ego - I get why this might be a double-edged sword but hear me out. Once you set a benchmark for the finished expectations from a project - tie it to the fact that it's something the world will see as a finished project from "you" and hence it can't fall below a certain quality threshold. For me. it used to motivate me to always push the project to completion and have it satisfy some baseline criteria.
Learn and grow with stakeholders - Some projects. you might not do alone and hence the coolest thing would be to learn from your collaborators and ensure they have a good experience working with you. Believe it or not. people and team skills are still one of the most important virtues for any team. Have fixed meetings. track your progress. hit your metrics and note down and share - what each of you learnt from the project. Projects offer collaborative opportunities and hence you can learn much beyond the books and the internet - you learn from people and in a lot of ways - what you learn will surprise you.
The more you passionately employ your learnings into real-time applications the more strongly your education will stick to you. ¬†

How to sell yourself
The next step after building projects is to share your work with the world and capitalize on it.

Few pointers on this are:

Have an online gallery - Every time you learn something. it would really help if you could maintain a online browsable gallery of your work. Be it your GitHub page or Dribbble gallery or LinkedIn profile or blog page. Just everytime you wrap up learning something. create an online snapshot for the world to view your thinking. approach. knowledge depth etc.
Look for interesting people and DM them: I used LinkedIn. Each time I found a person with interesting work - I would DM (Direct Message) them on LinkedIn and if possible. even get on a call to understand how they thought and learn from them. Seriously. it helps so much to get other people's feedback on your approach. Beyond this. there are obviously interesting conferences that you can just boldly sign up for. attend and be the newbie who talks and learns from everyone.
Confidence is free: In the early days in this new stream. you'll often feel imposter syndrome and underconfident - so start pretending otherwise. With time. it will grow into something more solid and with the knowledge and experience piling on. it would just compound. Confidence also helps express passion and clarity for the subject matter so the more you are confident about your projects and subject matter. the more people would value your work
I guess that about sums it up - in a nutshell - randomly search for ways to learn. iteratively keep sucking till you get better. build toy projects that make you happy and confidently talk about them on platforms. Rest. I'm 100% sure. the journey you take will help you figure out.

My story
Alright. now I'll be more specific about my story and things I did. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. thinking that a good college. a good job would be the only salvation. So naturally. once I got into the 4 year Civil Engineering program at IIT Madras. I thought that this would limit me from pursuing anything lateral. But in this internet-learning driven age. that's hardly the case.

To find what I liked - for a year. I dated a lot of career options - photo and videography. standup comedy. automotive engineering. consulting. designing. architecture and many countless others - mainly through hanging with different clubs of students in my college. ¬†Once I stumbled upon "software startups" I've just felt an irresistable pull to it. that stands to this day. Obviously there are a lot of days where I've doubted it too. but if it's your calling. some part of you always knows and gets attracted to it.

Now the specifics okay. I'll make it pointwise and list specific instructors and courses so that you can maybe check them out:

Disclaimer: You don't have to do it like me. Just read my opinion and do it the way most apt to you :)
I learnt the basics of programming in C Language from the hard copy book - How to C. by Prashant Kanetkar. It took me 4 months with my other college work helps understand the foundation of how a piece of code is designed. written. interpreted and executed.
Next 4 months. I learnt web development (HTML. CSS. JS) from DevEd. WebDevSimplified and Brad Traversy. I also use Laith Harb for time to time learning of new skills. Also. I used to build a lot of toy projects that these youtubers would post walkthrough videos of - this udemy course of 20 projects with Javascript is pretty sweet - link. Also learnt Git during this time
I used to also pursue first 2 hrs of any random long 7-8hr videos from FreeCodeCamp's youtube channel - anything from Data Structures and Algorithms to CyberSecurity to even color designing. I even did a bit of digital illustrations from from Gary Simon.
After this. I was consuming content and courses very fast. In the next 2months I learnt NodeJS. ¬†React and TypeScript. GraphQL. Docker and other misc topics. These are the most common industry technologies in use these days.
I even learnt basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and some Systems Designing from Algoexpert. A good place to start learning the basics of literally anything programming or computer related is Fireship - who does amazing 100second video intros of a tech.
From time to time. I've flirted with Machine Learning and AI courses from DeepLearning. ZeroToMastery and random blogs and projects and stuff. But these 2 sources are very strong for it
Next up. I was having trouble deploying apps and understanding large scale software so I studied systems designing from Gaurav Sen since it helps fall in love with the strength of computing. I also completed certifications from AWS. Google and Microsoft with the help of Stephane Mareek's amazing content
In fact. I feel that Stephane Mareek's course on Cloud Computing is a must-do for any software engineer to appreciate the beauty of internet and all cloud services that become the strong backbone of it. Just do this course. trust me.
Yeah and after that I got into generalist mindset and I was brushing up on everything from Figma for designing to Flutter for app development and was tinkering with over 10 frameworks and DevOps products at any given point for building great software.
To start getting more professional experience. I used to always offer myself up as a cheap developer to startups. I remember cold reaching out to 200+ engineers and founders (not HR since they have less of a say in hiring than actual engineers who lead teams) on linkedin over 4 months before I landed my 1st internship.
In startups. ¬†I could learn a lot everything about businesses - in the high-growth-vacuum environment that startups offer. Plus I made some money. re-invested that back in random tech-courses and business-books that I used to pick like a kid at a candy store and kept building and building a 2nd brain of mine in Notion.
I kept up my spirit and did create projects entirely from scratch on my own right after the 1st 6months even though they felt shitty and didn't work as well. Some. I couldn't even afford to keep running cause I would have to enter credit card details and I didn't have one back then. So I created YouTube videos or blog posts and shared the code as I sunsetted each project deployment. You can find a log here - link. Point is just keep trying honestly.

2nd brain in Notion
Yeah and after that I tried to run my own software startup. made some money and I failed to run it long term (here's the story of it - link).

I balanced all this work with college. Fun thing is. once you do projects. everyone wants to give you a shot - be it professors looking for programmers or startups looking for part-time developers.

A lot of times. people ask me how I managed my time or remembered so much. I do not. I just used "Google Calendar" and practiced using a lot of tools to keep reminding me to meet my goals and do my things. Every night before I go to sleep. I plan my next day's calendar for 10mins to be a good student. programmer. student-club head. brother. son. friend or any role that I feel is important dedicating my time to. Recently I even started to take Mondays to plan 3 to 4 most important things I wanted to achieve in each sphere of life in that week - like learning to cook. or reading a book. finishing an online course. deploying a project. teaching my mom about tech or even learning to play squash or salsa dancing with my friend - I tracked it all so I knew if I was missing out on time for any of my commitments.

My academics did take a hit no doubt - but I knew that I wasn't giving enough time to it and why I wasn't so it was cool.
Recently. I ended up applying to Carnegie Mellon University.

It took me a lot of research and advice - and I made this document to put down my thoughts. goals and opportunities - link. This was the single most important thing I did before choosing what I wanted to do next. I showed this doc to my seniors. people I knew and respected. family and friends and finally collated their advice into a decision.

For applying. here's all I did:

I gave the GRE test (325/340 with 4.5 in essay writing) and TOEFL test (111/120) though I didn't think GRE would have much weightage now. People say you gotta take paid courses and prep for 5 months and I don't believe it. Just mark your calendar. Go through this free material I aggregated in 2022. for GRE and TOEFL and you'll be able to get it done sooner.
Next. I talked a lot about my projects in my SoP. I wrote about majorly. creating impact through startups and software. you can give it a read - link.
My CGPA in academia was 8.01 out of 10 in my undergraduate college. I willingly didn't study as much in class or in pen-paper exams. But I pursued projects passionately and that's where I caught up on.
For Letters of Recommendation - 1. I got from the CEO/Founder 1st startup I worked with for 9months. Next. a letter from a Computer Science professor in my undergraduate whom I helped for free as a DevOps engineer on his logistics project. back in my 3rd year. I got my 3rd reco letter from my favourite Computer Science professor who had taught me 1 course (and that too I didn't score that well XD). but he just looked at my profile and work and decided to give me a shot. And yeah. that's where sometimes just asking gets you to. I just wrote him (and other profs too) an email and he called me for a 20min meeting and decided to help me out
I guess with all of that. I'm now headed for a Masters in Software Management to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I've messed up a lot. Have done a tonne of random things and kept exploring. Some of it worked. Most didn't.


In the end. I just have 1 advice - read a lot of opinions to expand your world view but at the end. internalize all that info with with what feels right in your heart. and trust me. just fuck it and do it.

Here's just a basic email thread exchange I had with 1975 passed-out alumni of Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) - exchanging talks about the way things are at IITM right now in 2023 vs in 1970. What ensued were views about IIT Madras and India in the 1970s. This is a fun anecdotal blog that tells 2 stories from different ages and how. from studying what happens in India's colleges. we can study the broader outlook of technological progress in the nation

1970s
Following is the message from an alum - Sudhir Krishna who passed out in the 1970s

B.Tech was a 5-year program. ¬† Half of the first year was spent toiling in the workshops wearing khaki uniform. ¬† The curriculum was course-heavy: ¬†Usually had 7 courses per semester. and reached 8 courses in the 7th semester (4th year). ¬† Continuous contact hours from 8 AM to 4:15 PM (with lunch from noon to 1:15 PM). ¬† ¬†Not much free time for creative projects except in the final (10th) semester. ¬† ¬†The German collaboration was still evident and some German faculty were still around. ¬† The campus population (students. faculty. administrators. staff) was much smaller than it is now. ¬† ¬†We all had single rooms in hostels. ¬† The annual cultural festival Mardi Gras was started and has now become Saarang (right?). ¬† ¬†Students were multi-talented -- academics. music. chess. bridge. quiz. drama/ acting. mimicry. sports. literary activities. etc. ¬† I myself was captain of the institute chess team. member of the institute tennis team for a couple of years. won the institute debate contest one year. represented IIT-M at the cultural festivals of other IITs. and became Under Officer in NCC Air Wing.
Also. back in the 1970s. India was still a poor country with a socialist economy. ¬† The country's global image was associated with poverty. backwardness. ¬† Only some American universities and companies were aware of the IIT brand. most notably Harvard Business School (where I got my MBA) and management consulting firms like McKinsey. ¬† Even back then. HBS admissions officers said they viewed IIT B.Techs the same way they did MIT and Caltech undergrads. ¬† But they made fun of Indian typewriters that were used for completing the application forms

I received an invitation from McKinsey for an interview that began with "Because of your Indian Institute of Technology background......."

2023
I recently graduated from IIT Madras. The hostel sector is quite lush with trees starting to form canopies above. The monkeys are not only more in number now. but more in daring as well. They're smart. bold and know how to work the system to get what they want.

The academics are strong and flexible with students having the option to pursue whatever they want. irrespective of their BTech department. A lot of application and project based courses have sprung up where we do assignments and mini-projects as opposed to just written exams.

Students are a lot in number now and it's fun to see everyone put honest hard work in their passions - right from technology and sciences to art. music. comedy and gaming. You find people of all interests and talents. The labs and workshop are still hands-on. though only about 40% of what it used to be in the 1970s. The departments have also developing into independent schools of specialization on their own with tonnes of activities. projects. lectures. events. yearly festival and more. In fact. the new department called "Engineering Design" - (near Velachery Gate) offers a lot of product designing and entrepreneurship encouragement in both- ¬†hardware and software. There's the department for management studies. humanities and flexibility of leveraging online platforms like NPTEL (https://nptel.ac.in) apart from attending in-person classes.

Here's my favourite part - the student-run project lab - Center for Innovation at IIT Madras - has over 20 teams and a 2 storey cool building. each one tinkering in topics all the way from AI. robotics. app development and racecar engg to energy efficiency. rocketry. product designing and rural tech (check this for more - https://blog.techsoc.iitm.ac.in/tech-iitm-in-5-mins/). So I'd say recovering from the pandemic. projects are at a powerful high

Hostel culture also seems to be re-igniting. guess a lot of it got hit during the pandemic years but teams like Schroeter. LitSoc and TechSoc are putting the fire back in. Athletics is strong and we won 1st in Men's championship and 4th overall in Inter IIT Sports Meet. We bagged 6 medals in Inter IIT Tech Meet (Golds in AI and entrepreneurship) and came 3rd in Inter IIT Cultural Meet.

In a nutshell. IITM has become the perfect home for pursuing anything passionately
Speaking of animals - monkeys are ruling the hostels so much so that we get a complaint email about monkey assault every week or 2. They're bold and smart and compete for food. ¬†The deer and blackbuck population is also fair and we do hangout with them in lawns sometimes. Dogs were actually moved out of the campus in 2019 since they used to hunt deer. There's a species of red ants we see all the time and snakes are barely spotted once or twice a year during rains. if anytime. Funnily. scorpions are seen near admin buildings and hostels sometimes
Workshops are lighter and we have much more time for creative activities. If you can think of it. there's a club for it working passionately.
On nearby places - Right now. Taramani is still go to for tea. snacks and cigarettes and food delivery orders. There are 2 cycle repair shops in insti. We get great breeze. most likely attributed to the greenery since the construction has blocked out the sea breeze. Student's these days hang out mostly around a huge mall outside Velachery. the food shops along the 100 ft. Road outside Taramani. Elliot's and Marina beach. Chetpet Eco-park this place called "Hidden Lake". Tada waterfalls in Andhra. and Westin bar (if you have money :)). But insti itself is I think the most happening place for so many technical. sport and cultural things that folks barely step out.
On innovation- Self-innovation and Entrepreneurship is being spearheaded by the new Director - Professor Kamakoti. In collaboration with Indian government. Professor Prabhu Rajagopal and his team - is doing several things to help students build products and eventually. companies. In fact. a couple of companies like Ather. HyperVerge. Solinas Integrity - born right inside IIT Madras - are making waves. Most recently Clueso got funded by YCombinator in 2023 and it furthered more students to do this.
On inside insti ¬†- The Dhaba outside Saras is now a full-fledged restaurant with all kinds of Indian food. juices and snacks. It's currently managed by the caterer - Zaitoon - but the tender is open for bids every 3 years. We had to recently monkey proof it due to the stealing incidents XD. The first floor of this is converted into a colorful place with a large television screen for student clubs to sit and ideate. Mummy Daddy Andhra mess outside Taramani is our go-to place for Biryani. Our tuition fees. without scholarship. are now INR 1.00.000 and hostel fees is INR 26.000 for each semester. The hostel bonding. as Srikanth said. is more shifted to clubs and messes are detached from hostels. This has helped in knowing a lot more breadth-wise bonding.
A lot of construction is going on now. There are 2 new Academic complexes. And a new sports complex is being made near the tennis courts
IIT Madras is a lot more creative. entrepreneurial. ¬† Its population is much larger. ¬† The post-graduate programs have grown a lot. ¬† Admissions quotas based on caste and gender have made the student population more diverse. ¬†(We had very few women during our time.) ¬† The IIT brand name is now world renowned. but still based largely on its undergrad B.Tech program and not yet for post-graduate and research programs. ¬† IIT alumni have distinguished themselves in America and reached the highest levels in industry and academia.

Also. India as a country has changed. ¬† It is capitalistic. entrepreneurial and technologically advanced. ¬† The country's nominal GDP is world #5 and projected to become world #3 by 2028. ¬† PM Modi. in my opinion. is a superstar on the global stage and gets royal treatment wherever he goes. ¬† Geopolitically. India is viewed as a counterweight to China. ¬† This is shaping up to be a China-India century and will be very evident by 2050. ¬† As for IITs. there are 23 of them now. ¬† While the 5 original IITs still rank at the top in India. some of the newer IITs are establishing niches of excellence for themselves. ¬†IIT Madras is ranked at the top.

Attaching a couple videos and pictures of campus here for your reference
Checkout these videos:

Fruit juices are still cheap. Canteens still open till 3am. Sunlight still glitters through trees. Students still mess around but have that drive to innovate and lastly - friendships are still stupid and meaningful.

27 JUL 2023 ‚Ä¢ 5 MIN READ

I recently graduated from Indian Institute of Technology. Madras. Here's 8 lessons I learnt from my 8 semesters and stories of how I learnt them so this is not some lame vanity post.


July 2019. entering college
Semester 1: It's a big world and trying everything. even lying outside your comfort zone is free. Be open to talk to everyone and make tonnes of friends. Semester 8 will teach you why its important. I picked up this lesson while borrowing 300 from a hostel guard to pay for pizza at 3am. attempting failed jokes at open mics and also while countlessly sitting in club orientations. It's always a good time to suck at new things :)


Semester 2: It's college. you can sign up for tonnes of things and asking anyone for help is free - people genuinely want to help. I learnt this while being disciplined and trained by the legends of the Raftar Formula Racing team as we championed 3 national trophies against all odds. Discipline and accountability take passion and convert it into wonders.


Semester 3: Just build projects that teach you skills you find cool. Persistence and hard work will help you trump all odds to be good at what you love. Maintaining motivation is 2/3rds of the game. Sitting in a COVID ridden world. using my neighbour (Jay Bafna's) WiFi to learn software development and making dumb projects like todo apps taught me that just inching a little closer to ambition. Preferably start an online presence of you that tracks your work well - write about your work and share


Semester 4: At this point. I'd say start taking bets on yourself and bold risks is the best - you're young - what's the worst that could happen? I learnt this core lesson when I decided to leave home and work at Farmako (YC S20) with a different set of legends. Having very little resources and pure hunger to survive and succeed over 9 months taught me a lot about the brilliant impact a small determined set of people can have on the world. Be stupid. take more bets. You're young and smart - you'll figure it out


Semester 5: You'll see a world of people who seem to have figured it out and gotten it right. But most of us are just winging it. I'd say at this point. just being real with a couple friends and still believing and taking bets is the hard path. I personally learnt it through shit tonne of mistakes. self-doubt and pain and tears that 2 things in life mattered - I was working on something I cared about. and I was around people I loved. I follow this principle to date. Not caring about a lot of external stimuli is a superpower you can acquire by just self-assessing.


Semester 6: You're growing now. Tension is building up and you're probably expected to have figured out life. You don't. In fact it's a good thing if you've failed over 3-4 times by now - it means you're trying and getting back-up enough. Having a vague idea of how you want to spend time - that's something I'd recommend having. A good idea here is take up something. and no matter how much it pains. see it through completion. Working with Logistics Lab. IIT Madras and Coursepanel taught me that enduring and reaching the finish line is way more important than procastinating for perfection or giving up midway. That's a major differentiating factor too.


Semester 7: You're probably multi-tasking at this point. Become boring. routine-driven - use a calendar and documentation tools to string multiple tracks together. Write a lot - it helps unclutter the mind and think clearly. I know it's boring but having control over how your time. energy and money flows by writing stuff down goes a long way. It helps aim long for a year and piece it down to what you and your team need to do today. I learnt this while helping Institute Technical Society (TechSoc). IIT Madras frame its vision from to 1700+ participants. 14 events and countless projects. I learnt that small tasks with directed effort moves mountains.


Semester 8: It's your turn to give back now. Now your old friendships will blossom and it's time to be ready for new ones. Be there as a mentor your junior self would have appreciated. Preferably take up a position of responsibility that's undervalued and difficult and lead a team through and through. no matter what it costs. I think the Inter IIT Technical Meet at Indian Institute of Technology. Kanpur where we went from stranded on a railway station to nailing medals in Kanpur (2000 miles away) in under 40 hours.


Most lessons are not my own and have been taught to me by amazing amazing mentors. friends. family members and I'm undeniably grateful to.

This blog won't solve your problems - hell. mine also took a fuckload of meanderings before I got to understand them. Think of it as more like - not repeating my fuckups. College is a mix of confusion and opportunities. wins and losses - in a short time frame so screw everything and feel free to ping me anytime if you're going through something and need a ear. Listen to all this - but the best part is - don't do it like me. do it like you. üòâ

Machine Learning projects may seem complicated at first glance. but in reality. they follow a systematic flow that. once understood. makes the whole process quite straightforward. In this blog. we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.

Let's first sing a song to kickoff this blog


In a nutshell. what are we gonna talk about
It's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section. I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead. I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!


Steps of ML
0. Become One with the Data
The initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data. identifying potential outliers. and understanding the relationship between different variables.

1. Preprocessing Your Data
Raw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning. normalization. and standardization of values.

When dealing with large datasets. it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as "batches". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor. and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.

2. Creating a Model
Starting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A "baseline" is a relatively simple. existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress. you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.

3. Compiling and Fitting the Model
Once you have decided on your model. the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function. optimizer. and the evaluation metrics. After compiling. fit your model to the training data. allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.

4. Evaluating the Model
After your model has been fitted. it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
In order to improve the model's performance. you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.

Remember. overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting. consider using techniques such as data augmentation. regularization layers. or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.

6. Iterate Until Satisfied
The above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.

8. Explore Advanced Techniques for Improvement
Once you have beaten your baseline. you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model. training for a longer period. finding an ideal learning rate. using more data. or using transfer learning.

Deep Diving into templates and tricks
Processing the Data
The first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it. thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data. where actions such as rotating. flipping. and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.

Shuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset. such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training. consider shuffling your data.

When processing your data. you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:

StandardScaler can give each feature zero-mean and unit standard deviation.
MinMaxScaler provides a non-distorting. light-touch transformation.
RobustScaler is useful for reducing the influence of outliers.
Normalizer provides row-based normalization. using l1 or l2 normalization.
Refer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.

Start with a Baseline
Starting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:

Creating a model: Define the input. output. and hidden layers of a deep learning model.
Compiling a model: Define the loss function. optimizer. and evaluation metrics for the model.
Fitting a model: Train the model to find patterns between features and labels.
Baseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. based on your project's requirements.

PyTorch
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Set the number of epochs (how many times the model will pass over the training data)
epochs = 100

# Create empty loss lists to track values
train_loss_values = []
test_loss_values = []
epoch_count = []

# Put data on the available device
# Without this. error will happen (not all model/data on device)
X_train = X_train.to(device)
X_test = X_test.to(device)
y_train = y_train.to(device)
y_test = y_test.to(device)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    ### Training

    # Put model in training mode (this is the default state of a model)
    model_0.train()

    # 1. Forward pass on train data using the forward() method inside 
    y_pred = model_0(X_train)
    # print(y_pred)

    # 2. Calculate the loss (how different are our models predictions to the ground truth)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred. y_train)

    # 3. Zero grad of the optimizer
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # 4. Loss backwards
    loss.backward()

    # 5. Progress the optimizer
    optimizer.step()

    ### Testing

    # Put the model in evaluation mode
    model_0.eval()

    with torch.inference_mode():
      # 1. Forward pass on test data
      test_pred = model_0(X_test)

      # 2. Caculate loss on test data
      test_loss = loss_fn(test_pred. y_test.type(torch.float)) # predictions come in torch.float datatype. so comparisons need to be done with tensors of the same type

      # Print out what's happening
      if epoch % 10 == 0:
            epoch_count.append(epoch)
            train_loss_values.append(loss.detach().numpy())
            test_loss_values.append(test_loss.detach().numpy())
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch} | MAE Train Loss: {loss} | MAE Test Loss: {test_loss} ")
Tensorflow
# Now our data is normalized. let's build a model to find pattern

# Set a random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# 1. Create a model
model_2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28.28)).
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10. activation="softmax").
])

# 2. Compile the model
model_2.compile(
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy().
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam().
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# 3. Train the model
norm_history = model_2.fit(
    train_data_norm.
    train_labels.
    epochs = 10.
    validation_data = (
        test_data_norm.
        test_labels
    )
)
Plotting training and testing loss
## Plotting training and test loss

# Plot the loss curves
plt.plot(epoch_count. train_loss_values. label="Train loss")
plt.plot(epoch_count. test_loss_values. label="Test loss")
plt.title("Training and test loss curves")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.legend();
Evaluating Our Model
Visualizing our model's predictions and its performance metrics is an integral part of model evaluation. Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems. evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.

Tracking Experiments
Visualizing our model's predictions
Apart from that. a good way to proceed is visualize. visualize. visualize!

It's a good idea to visualize

The data - What data are we working with? What does the data look like?
The model itself - what does our model look like
The training of a model - How does a model perform as it is learning?
The predictions of the model -How do the predictions match up against the ground truth (the original labels)
To visualize our model's predictions. it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values

def plot_predictions(train_data=X_train. 
                     train_labels=y_train. 
                     test_data=X_test. 
                     test_labels=y_test. 
                     predictions=None):
  """
  Plots training data. test data and compares predictions.
  """
  plt.figure(figsize=(10. 7))

  # Plot training data in blue
  plt.scatter(train_data. train_labels. c="b". s=4. label="Training data")
  
  # Plot test data in green
  plt.scatter(test_data. test_labels. c="g". s=4. label="Testing data")

  if predictions is not None:
    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)
    plt.scatter(test_data. predictions. c="r". s=4. label="Predictions")

  # Show the legend
  plt.legend(prop={"size": 14});
To efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations. it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.

Improving Our Model
Build the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....

Improving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation. compilation. and training stages.

During the model creation stage. you might add more layers. increase the number of hidden units in each layer. or change the activation function. In the compilation stage. changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.

This process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as "hyperparameter tuning".

Approaches to improve accuracy

Get more data -> Get a larger dataset that we can train our model on
Hyperparameter tuning -> Use more hidden layers or increase number of neurons in each hidden layer
Train for longer -> Give your model more of a chance to find patterns in the dataset
Save a Model
Saving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment. like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow. depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch. the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().

PyTorch code
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Create models directory 
MODEL_PATH = Path("models")
MODEL_PATH.mkdir(parents=True. exist_ok=True)

# 2. Create model save path 
MODEL_NAME = "01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth"
MODEL_SAVE_PATH = MODEL_PATH / MODEL_NAME

# 3. Save the model state dict 
print(f"Saving model to: {MODEL_SAVE_PATH}")
torch.save(obj=model_0.state_dict(). # only saving the state_dict() only saves the models learned parameters
           f=MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
Run on GPU
Running your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function. where device is set to "cuda" for GPU or "cpu" for the Central Processing Unit.

Conclusion
In conclusion. understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively. Remember. machine learning is an iterative process. and it's okay to go back and forth between steps to improve your model's performance.

Introduction
As we progress in the age of digital transformation. organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework. an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda. is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management. which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless. and how does it function? In this blog. we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.

What is AWS Serverless Framework and How is it Helpful?
The Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes. either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda. you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.

Installing Node.js and Python on Your MacOS Machine
Before we start with the Serverless framework. we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.

To install Node.js. we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:

brew install node

For Python. MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However. it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:

brew install python

To verify successful installation. type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.

Setting Up AWS and Serverless CLI on MacOS Machine
After installing Node.js and Python. it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:

npm i -g serverless

Upon installation. verify the version using serverless -v command.

To deploy your functions on AWS. you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command. replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin

How to Invoke. Deploy. and See Logs of Serverless Lambda Functions
To create a new service or function. use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example. to create a Python service:

sls create --template aws-python --path myService

To deploy this function to AWS. use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only. use sls deploy function -f functionName.

To test a function on AWS. use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.

What is AWS SAM and How to Set it Up on MacOS
AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions. APIs. databases. and event source mappings.

To install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS. first. install the AWS CLI:

brew install awscli

Next. install AWS SAM:

brew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli

Initialize a new SAM application using sam init. choose your desired runtime (e.g.. Python). and template. To build your application. navigate to the project directory and use sam build.

You can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API. you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.

To deploy your application. use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke "FunctionName".

If you need to delete your stack for any reason. you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.

You can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode. click on "Add Debug Configuration" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.

For Python packages management. you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.

Conclusion and Why Serverless is Useful for Cost-Saving
As you can see. the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating. deploying. and managing serverless applications. Moreover. by leveraging these tools. we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.

Serverless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage. it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions. which leads to significant cost savings. especially for applications with variable workloads.

We hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.

TechSoc IIT Madras was one of the most stressful and fulfilling decisions I made in my last year in institute. We upscaled the tech culture at the institute through organizing 20+ competitions. 15+ guest lectures - resulting in 22
products. events impacting 2000+ students. I‚Äôd personally recommend this to any person who shares these 2 traits -

passion of driving a solid tech culture at our university
willingness to test their limits to stand for something bigger than themselves
I‚Äôll talk mainly about 6 things about my tenure as TechSoc Head from 2022 to 2023. where we captured the engagement of over 2000+ students. having conducted 15+ guest lectures and 20+ technical events.

The Initiatives
The Experience
The Growth
The De-merits
A crazy story
Cool stuff I got to do
FYI - Although this blog is all motivational stuff. we failed a tonne of times. but we did end up making people smile and make amazing things - and that's what it's all about.

The initiatives
My approach was and always has been - invest in the team. then invest in the customer and then invest in the future. The fun part about this 3 step process is the more you invest in the earlier phases. you're actually also investing well enough in the latter parts.

Investing in the team
The most important part was always that each member on the team felt proud and challenged and happy about the work we did. They had to grow. they had to be happy and challenge their own problem solving skills - else it wasn't worth it.

So here are a couple things I tried and liked:


not the full team. some suckers missed picture day
A training period
Spent atleast a month for new joinees to get used to "entrepreneurial activities" - like studying companies. making presentations and pitching. drafting detailed reports. running collaborative projects. cold emailing. corporate relations. This helped the team learn a lot in a short period of time and gain confidence.

Here's a syllabus if it helps - link

But yeah. if you want top-quality. hard-working. smart people actually working with you on your vision - gotta train your army to fight. You can start by defining the vision of your team. and what culture you want to carry into this.

Meeting structuring
College is a complex time with lotta priorities. commitments and spontaneous plans. It is important to have a definite meeting structure so that you stay consistent and add a punctuality aspect to respect everyone's time.

If anyone came late. they bought ice-cream to everyone who came before.
If the meeting didn't end on time. then I would buy ice-cream for everyone in the meeting
Every meeting had a document and actionables that people could take back so we always met with a direction. discussed agenda as per time and walked away with usable data and direction.
This structure is something I learned from Sharavanakumar at Khatabook and to this day. I'm grateful for it.

OKRs
OKRs - helping break down the overall vision into just 3 things each of the 18 of us had to get right each week - while working with each other. We were 18 disruptors - 54 things per week. pointing in 1 direction - helped us grow like crazy.

Team Happiness and Culture
At TechSoc. you always get a birthday cake. If you're in person - team folks even show up for your celebration at 12AM. We ensured that in our weekly retros. we had shoutouts for everyone who did great work in that week. Every event we saved on. the surplus would go back to team treats and gifting goodies. We were transparent about our money and trusted each other with it. Apart from that. we'd enjoy late night sessions on the lawns playing games (Mafia. Truth and Dare. "Albatross") or singing or sharing stories about ourselves.

Investing in the experience

give them pizza. they will build amazing things
Every event at TechSoc was a collaboration with another technical team on campus. And they're usually busy with projects but do want the publicity on campus. Every meeting we had with them. went as follows:

Why are we doing this event? What do we want to takeback from it
What does the event do? What's the best date and why?
How will the overall flow of conducting look like?
How do we market it?
What do we need (human resources and props) to run it successfully?
What are some loopholes we should consider when organizing this?
Metrics tracking and SWOT analysis
All this information would then be captured in a document - sample. This document would contain all the plan. the necessary links and people collaborating on it.

On ground. here are some values we ensured each time we conducted the event

Participant is god. If it means you're cycling with one hand and doing repeated samosa deliveries. sticking posters everywhere or ensuring that they have water - you gotta do it.
TechSoc never gives up. No matter how much things screw-up. And they did. like. all the time. Once there was an internet issue in a seminar we were streaming while a billion dollar CEO waited on the other end. But we recouped and did the damn thing
After-event work happens super fast. Everything from prizes. to score updation. to social media. website updating and everything.
Investing in the big picture

Mandakini hostel team. who made a car that did obstacle detection realtime
"Always build on top of your previous work". A lot of what we did at TechSoc compounded in on itself over time. We started with arguing and justfying INR 7000 rupee budgets for paper plane events and in 1 year got to INR 1.5 lakh AI hackathons. The way to do this was:

Update the fricking website - ensure that the overall presence of TechSoc was always up to date with everything that we had achieved so other people could review. With time. as we did more things. we became more awesome and it kept compounding with time. This helped get external attention and investment as well.
Build extensive documentation - Every document. going in. with time. created such a strong clarity and database - everything from important contacts to event documents and plans and costs and the whole thing - just mind-blowing. It helped a lot of people collaborate and introspect and evolve work with time.
Align everyone. Repeatedly - Every meeting. or party. or failure point - it was super important to just tell everyone what we stand for.
The Experience
Technical Society is a relatively growing student body and so the job is obviously hard. The place my team had to start from was how to even get 5 people to show up for an offline event when we were reeling back from the pandemic. Key points of my experience are:


the aero contingent team from our university (L to R - Akshat. Ayush. Pranit. Reddy Anna. my Alak boi. Sukriti)
It‚Äôs a fricking rollercoaster - There are events that go super well and then there are others where 0 people show up. My highs were really high and lows were equally painful. I‚Äôve wanted to quit and dump so many times but then there were equally balanced nights of euphoria and adrenaline
It‚Äôs about the team- Investing in the team‚Äôs growth during the summer following my recruitment was one of the best decisions I made. Because this strong loyal team stood while we encountered multiple hits over failed early events in the first semester. And now I see the same shy-to-even-turn-on-their-video-camera students stay up 14 straight hours. jugaading food and leading the conduction of tech events on campus.
Diplomacy is everything - I‚Äôve had to be nice in multiple f-you conversations and taken a lot of sit from multiple participants and stakeholders at a lot of points. Being rational more than emotional. knowing the right words to pitch to the right decision maker for an approval. collaborating with other student bodies for mutual vision alignment - that kind of thing
The tech community has heart - Tech-community is introverted. reserved and fit the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù description (barring a few outliers). But these are the same people who will pour their heart out for finessing a project - right from scribbling on whiteboards to presenting products. stand by and help each other for free. bond over late night tea conversations and pizzas. fight when they‚Äôre sleep deprived and drive real impact to push the society forward. This inspirational set of people is worth fighting for
The Growth
Gigantic network - This is the most golden essence of being in an technology college. I reached out far and wide:

interacted and connected with the most passionate tech enthusiasts across all domains at my university
connected to nationwide college's top talent through a joint Tech board
became part of a top class university entrepreneur community
multiple companies (GitHub. Unacademy) that sponsored our events
Being a better planner - Every TechSoc event had to be granularly figured out - right from the why. to the domain. to the logistics (approvals. finances. food). marketing plans. grading patterns. feedback loop and process documentation. And prior to that - figuring out which initiatives to run for which target audience and how that tied into the TechSoc vision to provide something to students that they were missing out on.

TechSoc taught me about this more than anything. You have to be a better planner than you ever were when you‚Äôre handling over 5 Lakhs of budget and getting around 30-40 things right in stressful weeks.

Becoming a stronger person - A leader is looked up to be a responsible and strong person. But no one is born that way. You learn by getting hit with a brick in the face. I learnt to be resilient. have more patience. lose the fear of crowd handling. stand my ground in hard negotations. take in a lot of negative feedback and deal with some failures. There were a lot of times when I felt like running away from the problem but the beauty of this PoR is that it won‚Äôt let you. Even when you‚Äôre tired. or tied by administration or resource constrained and super close to giving up. It has definitely increased my self-confidence to stand up to any problem in the world with a - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre TechSoc. we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù attitude.

Being part of something bigger - I had a chance to stand for a strong tech culture at my college - even though it sometimes meant being unhealthily altruistic. Looking back. I‚Äôll have not regretted that I spent my last year complaining about not having a strong tech scene at univer. I‚Äôll carry with me the legacy of having led highly passionate believers who wanted to push the limits of what technology can be.

The De-merits

passing out after 40hrs on non stop competition work and logistics
Constantly stressed - In the early days. especially with the offline shift and even during the competitions. I felt responsible for too many things. It‚Äôs an unprecedented level of stress - that no one should rationally take. Passion might be good reason to do it. but not otherwise. You‚Äôre worried for an event. a team member‚Äôs growth. someone resigning. some plan getting delayed and simultaneously 0 participation in another event on the next day. Since the team is small. unlike other bodies. you‚Äôre involved personally in most things and while the growth is good - the cost it comes at. is also high
Personal sacrifices - Barely any time on most weekends. I remember just bouncing across meetings post 8pm on a lot of weekdays and then standing by the team. I‚Äôve missed a lot of social life. sometimes even personal goals (heck. I didn‚Äôt work on my startup during national competitions) and relaxing. as I struggled to move the needles of 3 different verticals whilst the cores were still warming up. The role does take a lot out of you and it‚Äôs not a good thing always.
A lot of ground-work - My leadership style has always been more hands-on. Might be a good or bad thing. I don‚Äôt know the balance. There are days when people won‚Äôt work upto your standards and you‚Äôll have to step in and help even though you really are just mad and might want to panic and yell at them to get it done. Compassion taught me to share the load - right from being a TShirt distributor to a sweeper to poster designer to food delivery agent.
A crazy story
I'll tell a story of how I learnt persistence. In 2023. I was leading a 90 member contingent from our university to participate in Inter IIT Tech Meet (a national level competition for solving technical challenges). I was managing 15 projects over 2 months and was also in charge of the logistics. travel and accommodation in Kanpur. I booked the train tickets for my contingent through our institute and they assured us of tickets to Kanpur. However. in on the day of travel. amidst 100+ things I juggled all the way upto the train station. I realized that our tickets from Chennai to Kanpur were waitlisted. The train was full and keeping in mind the safety of my team. I told them to get off and said we'd find another way. And so. this story begins with a huge group ¬†of people. staring down at me at 12am on a railway station. with hopes that I'd get them to our competition - 2000 miles away - in the next 36 hours.

I arranged for a bus back to the campus and stayed up till 3. trying to figure out how I'd get my team to Kanpur safely. with the limited budget I had. For context. our institute had a no-flight refund policy for competitions. We brainstormed multiple routes via permutations of bus and train but we'd reach late and fatigued. At 3:15am. Shreepoorna found a reasonable flight ticket deal from Chennai to Delhi. At 3:30am. I poured in all my personal savings of about INR 85000 (with a INR 10000 loan) and booked the tickets to Kanpur. Here's the celebration video of that too.


the moment the tickets for kanpur were booked at 3:30am (gut feeling- all these people are going to make great founders 1 day)
Next. I spent 2 hours breaking it to the 2 people. whose tickets couldn't be booked due to limited funds. At 4am. I was standing at Cauvery Hostel. getting rattled by a junior on how I'd failed my entire purpose as a leader. Returning to my room in a mess. I wrote a long email to the Dean. explaining the situtation before I passed out.

After a 1 hr nap. I woke up in cold sweats. informing our Dean with a long email - the entire situation. 9am. I showed up to their office. shaking. But the admin rallied with us and with their support. got the tickets for the remaining team as well.

After 2 hours we flew to Delhi. In-flight. I worked with the people solving the "entrepreneurship challenge" and got their submission right. Abhishek Gupta (on campus) was making the pitch deck all the way to 12 when we submitted it. before we finally got kicked out of the cafe we made our makeshift office. with just a single coffee order. Next. at Delhi. we haggled and arranged bus transport to Kanpur for all with a 40% discount. Turns out. back then. online bookings weren't considered valid and you had to physically haggle and get people in the bus.

Fun fact. we got screwed over by the bus guys who dropped us about 25km away and once again. stranded on a highway at 7am. our team is bargaining with auto drivers to get us there.

Finally. after the entire long journey. we reached Kanpur campus 10 hours before time. 24 hours after that. with a parched throat. I pitched and won the silver medal for my college at the entrepreneurship challenge. Oh and the savings I put in? I got them reimbursed a month later by tweaking around my cloud provider SaaS costs and showing AWS credits as expenditure (technically. I did lose the money).

This is my favourite story that I like to share as I can neither put it in my resume nor will it be a conventional interview question - but it is so fundamental to my way of working - Persistence. I'd rather sweat in a garage than recline in a cabin. Cause where other's see unconvention. I see genius. "Ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. are the ones who really do"

Here's another story blog I wrote about an initiative TechSoc created and ran - to motivate students to believe and build projects - link

Okay so this post is not actually about college ragging but majorly about Retrieval Generated Augmentation (RAG). a cool machine learning and indexing application I came across while building CloudPilot - "the copilot for cloud engineers"

What is CloudPilot? ‚úàÔ∏è
CloudPilot was a project we built with the vision of going from idea to cloud within 10 minutes.

The goal of the project was to enable any thinker to start with a business problem. quickly to research and come up with a wholesome engineering document that had the solution approach. its architecture and performance analysis done well in under 10 minutes.

This product was built at a hackathon in under 24 hours. Let me know if there are any improvements you want me to look at.

And with that. let's dive in. into the product flow



What does a cloud engineer do?
First. let's understand how cloud architects function and come up with infrastructure solutions for a given business problem. See. as a typical cloud architect - the flow is as follows

Step 0: - It starts with a problem statement such as a architecture for payment gateway or a data migration pipeline or a high availability server fleet setup.
Step 1: Ask the right questions - Several times. we go back and forth with the problem statement to understand what are the exact business requirements and what are important aspects that we need to optimize for.
Step 2: Research - With the given requirements. the standard approach is to go online. read up some blogs by cloud providers. read case studies and open source articles to get context and understand our problem statement. Here. typically a lot of time is just spent in finding the right article. Most software problems have precedents that have solved the requirement wholly or in parts. Hence. finding the right documentation for similar requirements is of paramount importance.
Step 3: Technical Requirements - Once we have asked the right questions. we prepare a brief technical document. highlighting the most important performance expectations from the software and then start researching what kind of cloud offerings do we require. We also quantify that to what extent do we want to look at satisfying a particular goal. eg: 500 TB of storage. 80ms latency in communication. 7 0s of availability. 8GB GPUs for ML training.
Step 4: List the building blocks - Here. we simply map each techinal requirement to an existing cloud service we can use and do a comparative analysis. If it's ML. it's gotta be Google Cloud. for availability and cost. it's gotta be AWS - that kinda thing. So we start listing cloud offerings such as EC2 (AWS). Maps API (Google Cloud) or Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Azure). We think of using these offerings as builing blocks for the entire architecture and justify why the offering is important
Step 5: Join the blocks - Here. we join together the building blocks as services that communicate with 1 another and draw a systems diagram that helps to understand how the overall system works. Which part does what function and how it's role fits into the overall requirement.
Step 6: Iterate - Once an end-to-end flow is ready. we do overall Product. Engineering and Cost Analysis and then we iterate upon the design to optimize for certain aspects - make it faster. make it cheaper. increase the storage. increase the redundancy - that kind of thing. And based on that. we improve the choice of building blocks and integrating them together in 1 system
Step 7: Templatize - Once a cloud architecture is ready. we start looking at using Cloud templates such as CloudFormation by AWS. Terraform by Hashicorp to easily just deploy the entire architecture and have a skeleton of it functional to understand performance on a practical level.
Thus. this is the overall flow of the entirety of coming up with a cloud architecture. Beautiful and methodical.

So if we were to copilotize this process we would need an AI agent who could read through all cloud architecture related blogs. docs. case-studies like an engineer and intuitively go through steps 1 to 8 and help arrive upon a solution.

And that's why we used something called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique where we retrieved the right list of documents from the internet and asked our Large Language Model to generate an answer from text that it studied from these docs.

Before we segway into what we did. let's study in short - what is this "Retrieval Augmented Generation" anyways?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)


Imagine you're a chef and you're trying to create a new dish. First. you go to your pantry (which has a vast array of ingredients). This is akin to the retrieval part. You take a look at different recipes you have used in the past or a recipe book for ideas. You fetch or 'retrieve' ingredients and inspiration based on these recipes.

Next. you start to combine these ingredients together. perhaps in a way you've never done before. You might modify some of the recipes to match your taste or to make the dish unique. This is similar to the 'generation' part of the process.

Now. let's say you have some guests coming over and you know their preferences. To accommodate them. you decide to modify your new dish even further or add some garnish to make it look more appealing. This is comparable to the 'augmentation' part. where you make some tweaks to make the final result better suited for its purpose.

Bringing it back to the context of AI and natural language processing. Retrieval-Generated Augmentation is a method where you:

'Retrieve' relevant data or content from a large dataset (like a chef searching through the pantry or recipe books).
'Generate' new data or content based on this retrieved data (like a chef creating a new dish using the fetched ingredients). and then
'Augment' this generated content. usually by making some modifications to better suit the task at hand (like a chef adjusting the dish to suit the guests' taste).
This method is very useful for tasks that involve generating text or other types of data. especially when you want to produce content that is tailored for a specific task. purpose. or audience.

It's also a way to improve the performance of machine learning models. by providing them with a richer. more varied dataset to learn from. The richer and more varied the 'ingredients' (i.e.. the data). the better the 'dish' (i.e.. the model's output) can potentially be.



How we built the damn thing
Part 1: "Retrieve"
For this we would leverage the open-source documents. blogs. systems diagrams and articles by major Cloud Providers such as AWS. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

We created a custom index of just these documents. Using Amazon Kendra. we indexed over 192000 such information webpages using its web-connector. Here. the major difficulty we faced was understanding which XML sitemaps did we have to index and how. Some documents were in Japanese and some were just plain irrelevant marketing content. So intelligent document structure filtering was required at this level to index the right documents for our search.

Thus. this helped us to get the best documents to pull in for a given query. For example the queries below.




Using Kendra for getting top documents for a given search query
Part 2: "Generate"
Alright so you've got the top 10 documents you're supposed to refer to. But how can we improve the experience of gleaning valuable insights for your given business problem? That's where we use the superpower of an LLM. It's like asking it to read all documents and answer over it

So. once we "retrieve" the documents from Amaz√∏n Kendra. we ask the LLM to take the top 5 most relevant documents. pass all the text in them as tokens to the LLM (number of tokens varies depending on the LLM. we used GPT-4 by OpenAI that takes in upto 8000 tokens). The LLM parses the text and via few-shot learning over the context of business problem and the documents from Kendra. "generates" a response for the end user.

This is the simple task. Get the relevant docs and then generate a textual response from the same. Let's improve the experience now.



Part 3: The end-to-end architecture
Stringing together this in an entire experience involved developing the following flow.

Get the input prompt for the business requirement from the user and generate a set of relevant questions about the business to ask the user. For this we used an LLM


We recorded the question answers and the business requirement. did some text summarization and trimming (using nltk to remove whitespaces. punctuations etc.) and then we pass it all as a cumulative context for searching best documents in Amazon Kendra

Next. we get the best docuements from Amazon Kendra as text. combine that with business prompt and QnA and pass it to our LLM for giving a textual response

Once we get the response. we return that. along with hyperlinks to the documents that Kendra returned so the user can get our summarized.structured answer as well as refer the source documents for more information at their own leisure

To help the cloud engineer with more specific information. we added a feature to generate the following from the textual answer
6. Systems diagram for the architecture proposed to understand how to link together the building blocks
7. IaaC code template - Basically a CloudFormation code template to quickly just spin up the architecture and study its performance and behavior in cloud
8. Cost estimation - based on information that the LLM has been trained on. using AWS pricing docs as data source

Lastly. we provided a chat interface for the user to keep passing more requirements (such as "make it cheaper?". "make the system faster?") to the service. Now. we pass a combination of these 4 things to the LLM to get an improved answer = original business prompt + QnA + generated answer + additional user request



What can we improve upon?
Here's the current complete system that was built:



Okay so this project was awesomely exciting but the main complaint I have from it is that it is too slow. It still takes 2 minutes to generate answers and diagrams. A way to improve that would be some compute on frontend or some level of caching

Also. the answers are still generic and unless the prompt is well-engineered. we wouldn't discover novel architectures and solutions. So. that's something we need to fine-tune for. Maybe some sort of a framework for the user to engineer their prompt even better. Asking better technical requirement questions for a given business prompt could be a good starting point.

Lastly. it's expensive. Kendra is expensive and so is using OpenAI. So the approach for solving this is - open-source it! A search index with Elasticsearch combined with a custom LLM such as the Llama. Lima and Flan-T5 models can help cut down on costs

Oooh. a cool feature could have also using voice to speech and language translation (with using localized cloud services docs) to provide multilingual support to our beloved copilot

In closing....
We're having a copilot for pretty much everything these days ever since the Generative AI hype cycle started so I just thought of creating something that could help engineers to better adopt the Cloud Services by any cloud and help leverage them in the best possible way

I'd rather sweat in a garage then recline in a cabin
The story for this starts with wanting to figure out how a student can get from point A in skillset to point B in skillset (their desired ambition) - given an educational ecosystem that provides certain opportunities. And we did realize it. atleast for 3000+ students in my undergraduate college.

I ran Coursepanel for a year and we built several cool things in this journey. I'll keep this blog fairly technical but also throw in certain snippets about entrepreneurship and lessons learnt along the way. Most of this blog is going to be about the technical implementation of this project. I have mentioned my learnings as an entrepreneur in the end.

Technical Deep-dive
Understanding Natural Language Processing and Vector Embeddings
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science. artificial intelligence. and linguistics. It involves programming computers to effectively process large amounts of natural language data. As part of NLP. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. developed by OpenAI. are designed to generate human-like text based on the inputs they receive. They are trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate contextually relevant text.

However. they do not know specific documents or sources they were trained on and don't have the capability to access or retrieve specific documents or databases during the generation process. Their strength lies in understanding and generating text that closely resembles human-like responses. thus forming a key part of systems like CourseGPT.

Vector embeddings are another crucial component of such systems. In the realm of machine learning. embeddings are a way to convert categorical variables into continuous vectors so as to feed them into a model. They can be used to capture the semantics of words in a language. relationships between items. and even user behavior in an application.


Basic demo of how words are converted into vector embeddings (source)

These embeddings. when stored in a vector database. form the basis of effective search and recommendation systems.

Building a vector database using a knowledge graph
For the purpose of this project. based on the previous training data. we turned our knowledge graph (aka ‚Äúskillmap‚Äù) into a vector database for storing entries and answering queries related to academic data. This was done in 4 steps:

Creating a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j: The first step involved modeling our data as a graph and storing it in Neo4j. Our nodes represent entities such as NPTEL courses. books. departments. etc.. and relationships represented the connections between these entities
Generating Vector Embeddings: The next step involved generating vector embeddings from our graph. These embeddings are a form of representation that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of your data in the form of vectors in a high-dimensional space. There are several techniques to generate graph embeddings. like Node2Vec. GraphSAGE. etc. This project used the Node2Vec library in Python to achieve the same. We ran Node2Vec algorithms on our Neo4j graph to generate node and relationship embeddings.
Store Vector Embeddings: The generated embeddings then needed to be stored for future use. Typically. we‚Äôd want a database that is optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. You could use a vector database like Pinecone. Faiss. or even Elasticsearch with a vector plugin for this purpose.
Querying the Vector Database: The final part involved using these vector embeddings to make our application smarter. For example. we could now perform operations like semantic search. recommendations. or similarity checks by comparing vectors. This involved querying our vector database for the nearest vectors to a given input vector. which gave us the most semantically similar entities to our query.
Scoping NPTEL data into the Vector Database and building a chatbot
To create a system like CourseGPT. we first need to load the relevant data into the vector database. Let's assume we have course data from NPTEL in a CSV format. This data can be processed and converted into vector embeddings using various techniques like Word2Vec. GloVe. or even using transformers-based models. These vector representations can then be loaded into the vector database. which allows us to perform efficient similarity search operations.

The vector database enables us to compare the query vector (which can be a representation of a user's query or a specific course interest) with all vectors in our database. and retrieves the most similar entries. These entries represent courses that are most relevant to the user's query.

Once the entries are returned. we need to translate these course vectors back into a human-readable form. This is where LLMs like GPT-3 come into play. These models can generate contextually relevant. human-like text based on the returned entries. The generated text can be as simple as a course name and description. or as complex as a detailed career path recommendation.

In this way. the synergy of NLP. LLMs. and vector databases leads to the development of an effective system like CourseGPT. Such a system can revolutionize the way we approach professional upskilling and corporate training by providing personalized. contextual. and interactive learning experiences.

The journey in a nutshell
The development and evolution of CourseGPT. spread over a 12-month period. could've been a significant step forward in the application of advanced technologies such as AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP). and Knowledge Graphs to the critical area of professional upskilling and corporate training.

The journey began with understanding the problem domain. setting the objectives and scope. and constructing the methodology flowchart. The decision to pick a test sandbox environment of similar nature proved instrumental in aligning the development of CourseGPT closely with the real-world challenges encountered in professional learning and development.

Deep dives into models of corporate training. specifically the Kirkpatrick Model. provided insights into the metrics for successful training outcomes. Skill mapping using a knowledge graph emerged as a novel and efficient approach to resolving course recommendations and facilitating an effective learning journey for the students.

Working with the NPTEL team and building a skill map for IIT Madras underscored the potential of this tool in academic environments as well. Implementing Natural Entity Recognition and NLP allowed us to extract valuable course tags and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Moreover. the research conducted at HyperVerge Academy (HVA) enabled a deeper understanding of the professional upskilling space. Facing and overcoming various challenges along the way. we succeeded in developing a competency engine and data model that significantly enriched the capabilities of CourseGPT.

Finally. CourseGPT emerged as an intelligent product. leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to recommend courses based on career goals. plan academic journeys. solve student doubts. and inclusively cater to diverse learners. The journey. although filled with complexities and challenges. offered valuable insights into the future of AI-enabled learning and set a foundation for ongoing research and development.

Here's the various launch videos of products that I built. just as a nostalgic flash from the past.





Why I failed to run it as a company.
With Coursepanel. we made around 35000 INR in revenue with 3000+ free users and then got stuck in a loop of developing without continuous customer interaction. I shut down Coursepanel in May 2023. I was embarassed. mentally disturbed and self-doubting when I did it. It was hard and it was like I had given up on a dream ¬†and failed myself. But picking up and moving on is the way forward. Here are a few things I learnt from this experience - these aren't novel learnings - these are the same fuckups most startup folks advise against but I did it anyway and learnt it again - at a heavy price:

Don't do it alone. It's not that I'm doubting individual capability - it's just that context switching has a very difficult toll when you ¬†want strong velocity in both business and innovaiton. Also there's the emotional burden of doing it alone. Worst case. atleast have a friend to talk to and help sort out a lot of operations and communications
It's best to build a shitty product with continuous customer interaction but no point of siloed building. no matter what you feel about current systems. Even asking and then building then again asking then building - i.e. an intermittent month-to-month setup might not help. Atleast talk to users each week.
Make money from the start. It's the only way to stay afloat.
Don't get to emotionally attached to your innovation or amazed by exciting new things you can do. Focus on the minimum that gets you paid. get it right and then expand with bolder experiments.
It's boring and requires discipline and routine to continuously outperform other teams. You have to consistently just keep pushing. Motivation is 2/3rds of this game.

So yeah. I guess that's about it. I was very passionate. worked very hard and was heartbroken - but I guess I'm carrying forward a lot - something that classroom would have never taught me. Let's see. I'm about to do something again in the Generative AI space. This time - business first though - get the "what are people gonna pay for" right and then expand from that base thought into technical innovation and exquisite design.

Problems define markets
Having a more accurate understanding of the market in which your product is really competing
A market is not tied to any specific solutions that meet those needs. That is why you see ‚Äúmarket disruptions‚Äù: when a new type of product (solution space) better meets the market needs (problem space)
The ‚Äúwhat‚Äù describes the benefits that the product should give the customer‚Äîwhat the product will accomplish for the user or allow the user to accomplish.
The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the way in which the product delivers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to the customer. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is problem space and ‚Äúhow‚Äù is solution space.
üí°
What = problem space
How = solution space
Lean product teams articulate the hypotheses they have made and solicit customer feedback on early design ideas to test those hypotheses.

Should you listen to customers?
It‚Äôs true that customers aren‚Äôt going to lead you to the Promised Land of a break-through innovative product. but customer feedback is like a flashlight in the night: it keeps you from falling off a cliff as you try to find your way there.

Using the solution space to discover the problem space
Hard for customers to talk about abstract benefits and the relative importance of each‚Äîand when they do. it‚Äôs often fraught with inaccuracies
This can be solved by techniques like "contextual inquiry" or "customer discovery"
The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. If you show them a new product or design. they can tell you what they like and don‚Äôt like. They can compare it to other solutions and identify pros and cons.
The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created
Divergent and convergent thinking
You should be practicing divergent thinking. which means trying to generate as many ideas as possible without any judgment or evalua-tion. There will be plenty of time later for convergent thinking. where you evaluate the ideas and decide which ones you think are the most promising.

you want to capture all the ideas that your team generated. then organize them by the benefit that they deliver.
Then. for each benefit. you want to review and prioritize the list of feature ideas.
You can score each idea on expected customer value to determine a first-pass priority.
The goal is to identify the top three to five features for each benefit.
There is not much value in looking beyond those top features right now because things will change‚Äîa lot‚Äîafter you show your prototype to customers.
A user story is a brief description of the benefit that the particular functionality should provide. including whom the benefit is for (the target customer). and why the customer wants the benefit.

üí°
As a [type of user]. I want to [do something]. so that I can [desired benefit].
¬†eg : As a professional photographer.I want to easily upload pictures from my camera to my website.so that I can quickly show my clients their pictures. ¬†

üí°
INVEST framework
I - independent of other stories
N - not explicit and must be flexible. open for discussion
V - valuable to customer
E - reasonlaby estimate scope
S - small
T - testable
¬†

Small tickets and smaller ticket batch sizes are better
Break tickets into atomic chunks. Trim extra stuff
The batch size is the number of products worked on together at the same time in parallel. Faster velocity of small batches -> faster feedback -> reduce risk and waste
The longer you work on a product with-out getting customer feedback. the more you risk a major disconnect that subsequently requires significant rework.
Scoping with story points
Story points - type of currency for estimating relative ticket size
Have a max threshold for story points
Good operating principle ¬†- break down stories with high points into smaller stories
Return on investment to prioritize
When you are building a product or feature. the investment is usually the time that your development resources spend working on it. which you generally measure in units such as developer-weeks (one developer working for one week).
It‚Äôs true that you could probably calculate an equivalent dollar amount. but people use units like developer-weeks because they are simpler and clearer
Visualizing ROI

Good product teams strive to come up with ideas like idea G in Figure 6.1‚Äîthe ones that create high customer value for low effort.
Great product teams are able to take ideas like that. break them down into chunks. trim off less valuable pieces. and identify creative ways to deliver the customer value with less effort than initially scoped‚Äîindicated in the figure by moving idea G to the left.
The accuracy of the estimates should be proportional to the fidelity of the product definition
The main point of these calculations is less about figuring out actual ROI values and more about how they compare to each other
¬†

Approximating ROI and Deciding on MVP candidate

Just comparing feature importance wrt one another. Once that‚Äôs done. arrange all features in this format as per benefit categories


Intentionally give them generic names so that you can more easily envision replacing them with what would be relevant for your product. ‚ÄúM1A‚Äù means feature chunk A for must-have 1. ‚ÄúP2B‚Äù means feature chunk B for perfor-mance benefit 2. and ‚ÄúD2C‚Äù means feature chunk C for delighter benefit 21.
Decide on the MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONALITY that will resonate with TG users
Look down the leftmost column of feature chunks and determine which ones you think need to be in your MVP candidate. While doing so. you should refer to your product value proposition
After this. focus on the main performance benefit you‚Äôre planning to use to beat the competition
Delighters are part of your differentiation. too. You should include your top delighter in your MVP candidate.
So if you‚Äôve made tentative plans beyond your MVP. you must be prepared to throw them out the window and come up with new plans based on what you learn from customers.

Moving on to MVP and early Prototyping
Use the broad term MVP ‚Äúprototype‚Äù to capture the wide range of items you can test with cus-tomers to gain learning. While the first ‚Äúprototype‚Äù you test could be your live MVP. you can gain faster learning with fewer resources by testing your hypotheses before you build your MVP.

What is/isn't an MVP?

There has been spirited debate over what qualifies as an MVP. Some people argue vehemently that a landing page is a valid MVP. Others say it isn‚Äôt. insisting that an MVP must be a real. working product or at least an interactive prototype.
The way I resolve this dichotomy is to realize that these are all methods to test the hypotheses behind your MVP. By using the term ‚ÄúMVP tests‚Äù instead of MVP. the debate goes away
Product vs Marketing MVP Tests

Marketing test - You‚Äôre simply describing the functionality to prospective customers to see how compelling they find your description
MVP Tests - validate your product will involve showing prospective customers functionality to solicit their feedback on it. You may be showing them a live beta product or just low fidelity wireframes to assess product-market fit
Marketing tests can provide valuable learning. but they‚Äôre not an actual product that creates customer value. At some point. you need to test a prototype of your MVP candidate
Quantitative vs Qualitative MVP Tests

Qualitative - you are talking with customers directly. usually in small numbers that don‚Äôt yield statistical significance eg: If. for example. you conducted one-on-one feedback sessions with 12 prospective customers to solicit their feedback on a mockup of your landing page. then that would be qualitative research

Quantitative - conducting the test at scale with alarge number of customers. ¬†You don‚Äôt care as much about any indi-vidual result and are instead interested in the aggregate results.

eg: If you launched two versions of your landing page and directed thousands of customers to each one to see which one had the higher conversion rate. then that would be a quantitative test.

Quant = what. how; Qual = why

Quantitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many‚Äù: what actions customers took and how many customers took an action (e.g.. clicked on the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button). But quantitative tests will not tell you why they chose to do so or why the other customers chose not to do so. In contrast. qualitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: the reasons behind different customers‚Äô decisions to take an action or not.

If you don't know where you're going. you might not get there
Objective Key-Result (OKR) is a framework of approaching a goal/project that ensures that you and your team make 1000s of decisions and steps. while being aligned on a common vision.

This blog will largely explore the key learnings I've gathered from this awesome book on the topic called "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. If you're curious. this person learnt the OKR framework from top management at Intel and replicated successfully. the same principles - at Google and grew the young startup at breakneck speed with people and products - whilst retaining the core vision of making information easily accessible to all.

The very 1st slide John showed to team Google said OKRS: "A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization"

I'll litter this blog with excerpts and stories that the book explored and I found most helpful.

OKR short intro
Objective is the WHAT is to bo achieved. These are significant. concrete. action oriented and ideally inspirational.

Key Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound. aggressive yet reliastic. Most of all they're measurable and reliable.

Where an objective can be long-lived. rolled over for a year or longer. key results evolve as the work progresses. Once the KRs are completed -> the objective is achieved

Thus. OKRs channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse ops. lending purpose and unity to the entire org. This is supremely important at startups or young companies where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction

The maker of OKR
Andy Grove. an Intel exec is credited for having created the management system of OKRs when Intel had taken up the responsibility of Operation Crush - a race to win in the 16-bit microprocessor market with their 8086 product in a time where cheaper and less performant products were eating market share.

It was the glorious story of how Intel dumped the business of memory-chip and went all-in on microprocessors and completely "crushed" every other contemporary compute company.

Here. are the 1st tenets of this system. by Dr. Grove himself:

Less is more
Set goals from the bottom up
No dictating
Stay flexible
Dare to fail
Here's a free OKR template for your use - link

Great companies take the surplus cash flows created by their sustainable competitive advantages and then either return those to shareholders or reinvest those in their core franchise or - and this is the litmus test of greatness - reinvest those successfully in new activities or markets
"Unusual Billionaires". by Saurabh Mukherjea. is an unusually riveting & practical thesis. It is a collection of stories of brilliant companies that made their dent in the world by continuously innovating. providing great service. and building powerful teams & stable assets. It teaches us the unconventional yet core fundamental process of sustainably building great companies amidst this era of venture-backed rocketship dreams.

In this blog I'll be listing snippets from the book. that teach us all. the values of how great companies our built and share my thoughts on the same. ¬†In this market of the recession of fly-high crashes of crypto exchanges. the gloom of overpowering AI agents & plummeting stock prices. I think we can all take a page out of these learnings & realize how lasting services are created.

Asian paints
Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness. it turns out. is largely a matter of conscious choice. ~ Jim Collins (Good to great)
An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire ~ Yuval Nova Harari
A great company attracts the best talent. commands respect in the business community and. more often than not. trades at a premium in the stock market
Greatness is meant to be an enduring quality. Stock prices are an effect and not a cause of a company‚Äôs greatness
Metrics in a great company
Revenue growth of 10% and ROCE of 15% every year for non-financial services companies
Loan book growth of 15% and ROE of 15% every year for financial services companies
‚ÄúWe have consciously stuck to a sector which is growing and offers decent potential and have always strived for excellence across all functional areas. But it is not because somebody is observing us and is going to applaud us. We have just stuck to our knitting sensibly as the sector has evolved over decades - Jalaj Dani (promoter)
By obsessively using tech and talent to improve on internal processes and efficiencies. these companies put considerable distance between themselves and the competitions. In particular. this focus on efficiency and cost reduction helps the champion companies sustain high levels of profitability in a way that most of their rivals simply can‚Äôt match
Create and nurture an environment in which a multitude of talented minds work in harmony so that mutual competence is reinforcing rather than debilitating
IBAS framework - Innovation. Brands & rep. architecture. strategic assets
Innovation - shopkeeper would get 3.5% extra discount. if. without fail. he made payments on time throughout the year. adoption of computers & GPS
Brands & rep - Asian Paints changed their messaging to maintain an emotional connection with their target audience. Thus came the brand ambassador of a mischievous kid with a can of paint (name - ‚ÄúGattu‚Äù)
Architecture - Creating a truly independent board of directors to help shape evolution of the firm. Rapid career progression for those who perform with job rotation at reg. intervals.
Empowerment allows creativity. It‚Äôs about the feeling of being a family - Jalaj Dani
Strategic assets - sources of competitive advantages - intellectual property. licences. regulatory permissions. access to natural resources and natural monopolies
On the trust Asian paints built - ‚Äú50% of dealers won‚Äôt check their accounts. despite having access to a web portal which gives them real time updates on their accounts‚Äù
Berger
The most difficult thing to change at a company is to change its people

Don‚Äôt recruit someone who is not able to do a job. just to fill a vacancy. Secondly. even if we don‚Äôt have a job. but you come across the right person. you must recruit him

In FY13. talent and skill are increasingly becoming scarce and it requires considerable effort to identify. engage and retain such talents. The report also added that salary alone is not the criteria for satisfaction of deserving employees and that the firm needs to offer a participative work environment and an open culture

Marico
I strongly believe that culture can be a source of competitive advantage in an org and it is impossible to copy. The org‚Äôs culture is a major driving force in the execution of strategy. Correct culture helps in proper execution of strategy by helping everyone align on the same page (Mariwala)
A promoter supporting and listening to the board. although being a 60 percent shareholder. makes indep directors feel proud because we think that we are able to contribute to Marico. These things don‚Äôt reflect directly on the balance sheet. P&L or share price. but these are inputs which go into creation of long-term shareholder wealth
Page
Many companies justify risking balance sheet & profits for fueling growth. However. Page has maintained steadfast financial discipline whilst expanding its operations and at the same time. its share prices have also kept up an upward trend
‚ÄòOur managers understand that it‚Äôs not about having power but about how you empower your subordinates & bring about the best results from your team members. Hence each member behaves like a leader and that gives us a winning culture - Sunder Genomal
‚ÄòFrom day one. Mr Genomal has pushed us into adopting a process-oriented approach. Almost everything we do at Page is part of an Excel sheet.
‚ÄòWe want to keep our distributors‚Äô balance sheets healthy because our business is dependent on their finances. If they have the wrong inventory stuck with them. it neither helps us nor them
Even the core projects will not be taken up unless they promise an ROCE of atleast 20%
Axis bank
Hemant Kaul on Supriya Gupta - My offer letter from Axis Bank had no details about compensation. But the temptation to start a new bank with Gupta overshadowed all my inhibitions - On joining Axis
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in a commodity business. the only way to thrive is to be a low-cost producer. And when you‚Äôre selling money. you‚Äôre in a commodity business - Duff McDonald
Shikha Sharma - I advise other companies‚Äô CEOs not to fall into the trap where you go - Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth - They feel a tremendous pressure to grow. Well. sometimes you can‚Äôt grow. Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to grow. In certain businesses. growth means you either take on bad clients. excess risk or too much leverage - Jamie Dimon (CEO of JPMC)
The shift from people to processes was critical as the bank was moving away from reliance on corporate banking to retail banking (which needs very high use of data & analytics based decision making to grow the business whilst maintaining commercial viability
This operating structure makes the CEO of a pvt bank both less powerful than a promoter of a non-bank company but more influential than the CEO of a non-bank company (pg 209)
Employee policies are very consistent at Axis Bank and there is little ambiguity and subjectivity in the pay hikes and bonuses. All supervisors have to clearly explain the ratings they assign to their subordinates - something that decides pay rise. promotion & bonus. You won‚Äôt find this in other pvt sector banks. where a lot of randomness prevails in salary hikes. bonuses & promotions where lower rated employees have got higher bonuses
HDFC bank
Building a visionary company requires 1% vision & 99% alignment - Jim Collins
An org‚Äôs ability to learn & translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive advantage - Jack Welch
HDFC Bank‚Äôs strength rests not so much on the uniqueness of tech it uses but in the way that tech is lined up in a clever process flow i.e. not envisaged by other banks.
Strong focus on systems & procedures meant that the people who succeeded them did not find it difficult to take over responsibilities quickly
Astral
We came to a point where our day to day business was to just survive. Sandeep Engineer
We had to build scale. We made the market for CPVC in India and if we didn‚Äôt increase capacities aggressively. someone else would have borne the fruit of our hard work. Sandeep Engineer
Instead of copying foreign technologies. Engineer forged technical partnerships with global majors to launch innovative products in India
His biggest strength is simplicity and humility. There has been no change in his personality even after the manifold growth of Astral. He still drinks tea from a roadside stall along with his dealers
Engineer would tell plumbers not to see themselves as plumbers. but as doctors who treat the big problem of leaking pipes in homes
Greatness is not Everyone‚Äôs Cup of Tea
Strategy is about making smart choices and execution is about relentless implementation ~ Phil Rosenzweig
The business of business is a lot of little decisions every day mixed up with a few big decisions ~ Tom Murphy
Those who achieve long-lasting success in India are often those who are unflashy . introverted. determined. and intelligently tenacious
Rahul Dravid‚Äôs of the business world - rare. determined and constantly seeking to improve the edge or the advantage they enjoy vis-a-vis their competitors
What makes a great company:
Theme A - Focus on the long term (more than ten years) without being distracted by short-term gambles
Theme B - Constantly deepen the moat around the core franchise using the IBAS framework
Theme C - Sensibly allocate capital whilst studiously avoiding betting the balance sheet on expensive and unrelated forays
Ability to steadfastly focus on doing the same thing for decades on end whilst gradually strengthening their franchise. generating surplus cash from that endeavour and then giving much of that back to shareholders whilst reinvesting the rest judiciously
Ram Charan - Leaders who say ‚ÄúI have got ten priorities‚Äù don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about
Jim Collins(Great by Choice. 2011) - 20 Mile March requires hitting specified performance markers with great consistency over a long period of time. It requires 2 distinct types of discomfort. delivering high performance in difficult times and holding back in good times
Good management teams work on proving a concept before investing a lot of capital. They are not likely to put a lot of money in all at once. hoping for a big payoff - Michael Shearn
Firstly. diversifications if any. are consciously restrained. instead of breaking or stretching the balance sheet. Secondly. surplus cash. when available. is returned to shareholders when in can‚Äôt be effectively deployed without dragging the ROCE down sharply. Whilst all of this might sound straightforward. these axioms are rarely implemented by Indian promoters who all too often treat their listed companies as their personal fiefdoms and short-change the minority shareholders
A company‚Äôs profitability increases as it moves up the value addition chain
Competitive advantage - if value added is the difference between the cost of a company‚Äôs inputs and that of its output. then competitive advantage allows a company to add more value than its rivals. Furthermore. a sustainable competitive advantage enables a company to continue sustaining this extra value addition over long periods of time
Unless innovation becomes a process which a firm lives day in and day out. the firm will appear impressive initially. and then ultimately disappoint. A product can be quickly outdated. but a successful brand is timeless

What is Back of the envelope?
A Back of the envelope calculation is a simple arithmetic operation frequently carried out on a little piece of paper. like an envelope. Back of the envelope analysis quickly generates a ballpark figure using approximated or rounded figures. An estimate is more accurate than a wild guess but less exact than a formal calculation using precise numbers in a spreadsheet or other program. These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.

In honor of physicist Enrico Fermi. back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.

In this article. we will talk about this methodology's history. applications. and best practices. Furthermore. I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations. Just a disclaimer - the calculations that are about to be added. are made with heavy assumptions - looking at Twitter 2.0 as a new service that we‚Äôll be building & basic components required for the same. The calculations don‚Äôt involve considerations of economies of scale. redundancy. replication and most estimations that involve scaling. We are just understanding a basic implementation of storage for the app. for the scale it is it


Twitter 2.0‚Äôs System Design diagram shared by Elon Musk in November 2022 - Source

Why are back of the envelope calculations needed?
The calculation generally informs us if the design can satisfy the functional requirements. such as the number of supported users. response latency. and resource needs. For instance. when deciding between different architectural designs. the simplest question to ask is whether one server is enough. To get a ballpark figure. we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require. if not one.

Notable Industry Applications
Some of the use cases where back of the envelope calculation has been used:

An important Internet protocol. the Border Gateway Protocol. was sketcBeforein 1989 by engineers on the back of "three ketchup-stained napkins". and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.
UTF-8. the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.
The Bailey bridge is a type of portable. pre-fabricated. truss bridge and was extensively used by British. Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.
The Laffer Curve. which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income. was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.
We've looked at some of the important historical applications of the back of the envelope. now we'll examine the arithmetic process to see how we can utilise it to solve our own issues. This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.

Getting Started with Back of the Envelope
Whenever we try to learn something new. we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly. when beginning system design estimations. we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers. used for estimating the speed of a system. are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency. as a term. helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example. the latency of the best video chat applications. such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.

How can we implement this?
Before approximating the real utilization. we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance. we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.

How can we guess the real usage?

The utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and. if necessary. further divided) and combined.

For instance. we might anticipate 1K active users. each of whom submits 15 requests daily.

15K requests per day. or 15K/86400 requests per second. are involved.

An effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly. Nobody likes to multiply by 86400. To give 0.2 seconds to serve a single request. let's round to 20K/100K. We need to set up at least 4 computers if we know that it takes 0.7 seconds to serve one request. Of course. you don't want to live on the edge. so let's increase the number of machines by a buffer and make it ten.

How to calculate quickly
If someone asked you to calculate: 2456000 x 4598; that would slow things down. wouldn‚Äôt it?

The simpler way to calculate quickly would be instead of spelling down a whole number. use small numbers paired with an abbreviation for magnitude (or. if necessary. exponents). 1K as opposed to 1000.

When given a huge. excessively exact number. such as 7432. immediately translate it to 7K. Anyhow. you are estimating.

This format for numbers makes multiplication and division quick.

KK is M. [K is Kilo; M is Mega]

G/M is K. [G is Giga]

4K7M = 28G.

Round both of them towards a small multiple of a power of 2 or 10 to work with larger numbers.

2714 ~= 3010 = 3000.
6500/250 ~= 6400/256 ~= 100 * 2^6 / 2^8 ~= 100 / 2^2 = 25.
Where to start Back of the envelope?
List the common use-cases of the system and decide which critical resources they require. You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start. but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?

Varied use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance. serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU. whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM. Since you need to purchase machines that are maxed out on both dimensions. hosting all those services on homogeneous machines would waste CPU and RAM.

Such differences indicate those features should be split to different services. hosted on independent sets of machines.

Real-world case study - Storage Costs borne by Twitter

Problem: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements
Please note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers from Twitter.

Assumptions:

300 million monthly active users.
50% of users use Twitter daily.
Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
10% of tweets contain media.
Data is stored for 5 years.
Estimations:

Query per second (QPS) estimate:

Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000
Let‚Äôs start solving
There are 2 important queries that need to be addressed for any system:

‚ÄúRequests per second‚Äù at the server level
‚ÄúQueries per second‚Äù at the database level.
Let‚Äôs start with ‚Äúrequests per second‚Äù & what inputs are required to estimate its number

Users: Twitter has 300 million active MAUs. Not every user on Twitter is an active post-maker. 50% use daily - 150 million DAU
Usage per DAU: 10-25% make a tweet. Again. this doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; getting within an order of magnitude should be fine. Say each DAU. on average. makes 2 tweets: so 0.25%*2 = 0.5 tweets per DAU.
Scaling factor: Usage rate for a service has peaks & valleys throughout the day. Eg: The usage rate for your favorite e-commerce store or food delivery app will heavily increase in the case of discounts or sales in a particular festive season. We need to estimate how high the traffic would peak compared to the average. This would reflect the request per second peak where the design could potentially break. Most people tweet in the morning. so the tweet creation traffic is twice the average when US east coast wakes up.
Thus. total tweets in a day = 150 M DAU * (0.5 tweets/DAU) * (2x scaling factor in the morning)
Thus. requests per second = n/(number of seconds in a day) = n/86400 ~ 1500 tweets per second.
Let‚Äôs now look at how much storage is required for storing multimedia files for tweets.

150 million daily tweets. Say 10% of these tweets contain pictures of average size 300kB each & 1% of tweets contain videos of about 50MB each.
Let‚Äôs assume that the files are replicated with 3 copies each & atleast stored for 5 years.
Storage required for pictures = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.1 of tweets have images)* 300kB (image size) * 3copies = 13.5TB.
Storage required for videos per day = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.01 of tweets have videos) * (50MB video size) * 3copies ~ 225TB.
Total storage required for multimedia files per day = 238.5TB
Just the text for a tweet can be stored within 160B (i.e. 1280 bits ~ 160 characters per tweet on average)
Storage required for tweets per day = 150 M * (160B tweet size) * 3copies = 72GB
Let‚Äôs calculate overall storage cost for Twitter
Thus. we learnt that. for running Twitter. in the most basic sense. the following requirements must be met:

Assuming no data compression & our simple 3x replication. in the most basic form - 238.5TB blob storage required for storing all the multimedia of tweets that arrive in a day. 72 GB storage in database is required just for storing the basic tweet content.
Twitter was founded in 2006. However. it launched image sharing in 2011 & video sharing in 2013.
Thus. we can assume. that average storage required per day for videos uploaded by a growing user base can be our current estimate multiplied by a normalization factor of 0.6 (considering 15% of user growth on average. every year. since year of founding).
Thus. we have about (225TB video storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (9 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 443.5PB videos stored.
Similarly for image storage we have (13.5TB photo storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (11 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 32.52PB images stored
To store total multimedia for 11 years worth tweets. in the most fault tolerant & redundant manner. we need - 443.5+32.52 ~ 476.02PB (this figure is close to the actual ballpark around 500PB that Twitter has officially shared here)
Twitter uses AWS for storage of tweets & accompanying multimedia files. Say we use intelligent tiering by S3 to pay for data. that is most recent & popularly accessed. Other data. we can archive. & fetch on demand & pay for.
Estimating the media storage cost
476.02PB can be broken down into. say - 300 PB till 2019 (considering that video & images got introduced late) and 276PB after 2017.
Assuming the worst case pricing of S3 (the standard pricing) - All the multimedia of the last 3 years‚Äô tweets can be stored in S3 regular access & the other. can be stored in S3 archives (so we save cost) Thus. as per S3 pricing values. we end up paying:

For 300PB in archive: 308.073.20 USD monthly

For 276PB in regular tier: 5.935.645.70 USD monthly

Every year. our estimate of Twitter. pays 6.243.718.90 USD monthly. to store our images & videos.

Estimating the database cost for our tweets
Let‚Äôs use AWS relational database DynamoDB to store tweet data in a structured form - such as user info. tweet text. number of likes & retweets.
Twitter needs to store 72GB of tweets in a regular relational database. each day. to keep the lights on.
Again. estimating our normalization factor of 0.6 to aggregate tweet data. across 16 years since Twitter supporting text sharing right from the start. we get - (72 GB tweet data per day) *(365 days)* (16 years since tweeting was launched) * 0.6 = 252.28TB
Thus. using a standard on-demand DynamoDB (unoptimized for cost. but great for scale) - the storage cost comes to 603.355.92 USD monthly. to store our data.
For an actual analysis of all the databases Twitter uses. checkout this reference link
Here‚Äôs the actual AWS calculator cost estimation performed for this purpose.

Thus. this most basic. unoptimized design of that we made. pays 82.164.897.81 USD = 82 million USD every year to AWS. to keep providing its storage services only.

We have not even begun to discuss the computing costs. the data science costs in the cloud. Also. to keep this article a light read. we haven‚Äôt taken into consideration scalability solutions such as caching. multi-AZ databases and several aspects of storage itself.

Thus. you might now understand why Elon Musk is bent on optimizing this system a lot & even implementing the ‚ÄúDeep Cuts‚Äù plan to reduce infrastructure costs by a billion. But trying to fire 50% of the workforce and have the rest leave because the ship is sinking still doesn't make sense. To top it off. if your major problem is infrastructure cost you don't fire engineers. you task engineers to reduce infrastructure costs. Now. we may not agree or disagree with this logic. but atleast we‚Äôve learnt how to ballpark the financial element of the same.

Cheat Sheet for Back of the Envelope
We studied a way of estimating the storage cost borne by Twitter. But what about getting the speed of a video-game streaming platform? Or the requests per second of a payment gateway?

Fear not. here are a few important numbers that we can use to estimate useful metrics of any software system & what corresponding technical requirements it must be able to satisfy.

What do we understand from this

Memory is fast. but the disk is slow.
Avoid disk seeks if possible.
Simple compression algorithms are fast.
Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible.
Data centers are usually in different regions. and it takes time to send data between them.
In a nutshell
A lot of back of the envelope calculations are done with just coefficients and exponents. e.g.. c‚àó10e. Your goal is to get within an order of magnitude right that‚Äôs just e. c matters a lot less.

What did we learn

Back of the envelope calculations allow you to take a look at different variations.
When designing your system. these are the kind of calculations you should do over and over in your head.
Know the back of the envelope numbers for the building blocks of your system. It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers. you have to know how your subsystems perform. You can't make decent back of the envelope calculations if you don't know what's happening.
Monitor and measure every part of your system so you can make these sorts of projections from real data.
I hope you understood how systems are operated in terms of estimating engineering infrastructure requirements. provisions & costing. What‚Äôs the one system that you want me to target next for back of the envelope analysis?

üí°
Tensor is a number/collection of numbers that maintains its meaning under transformations
üí°
More complex. but correct definition - An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules.
Each index of a tensor ranges over the number of dimensions of space. However. the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta).

Tensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices). vectors (that have exactly one index). and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.
Tensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity. fluid mechanics. and general relativity.
Beginner-friendly
Clearing the meaning. usage and confusions about tensors in ML and math
Tensors. a crucial concept in the field of machine learning. deep learning. and data science. often become a stumbling block for many learners. To fully grasp the idea. we'll break it down. explore examples. and demystify various related aspects such as rank. dimension. components. indices. size. and shape.

What are Tensors?
In simple terms. tensors are a generalization of scalars. vectors. and matrices. They can be seen as multidimensional arrays of numbers. with each dimension known as a rank.

A scalar is a single number. a tensor of rank 0.
A vector is an array of numbers. a tensor of rank 1.
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. a tensor of rank 2.
A 3D array. or a "cube" of numbers. is a tensor of rank 3.
The ranks continue to increase to define higher dimensional spaces.

Breaking Down the Definition of a Tensor
The formal definition of a tensor. "An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules." often overwhelms beginners. So. let's simplify it:

"nth-rank tensor": Rank refers to the number of dimensions or indices the tensor has. For example. a rank 1 tensor is a vector (which has one dimension). a rank 2 tensor is a matrix (which has two dimensions). and so on.
"m-dimensional space": This refers to the size of each dimension. For a matrix (rank 2 tensor). this would be the number of rows and columns.
"m^n components": Components are the individual elements or data points that make up the tensor. For example. in a matrix. each number is a component.
Simplifying with Examples
Consider a 3x3 image with three color channels (Red. Green. Blue). It is represented as a 3D array or a rank 3 tensor. with dimensions of 3 (height) x 3 (width) x 3 (color channels). It would have 3^3 or 27 components (individual color values for pixels).

Delving Deeper: Case of a 4x4 Image
Let's take a more specific example: a 4x4 pixel image with three color channels. Here. the tensor would have a rank of 3 (height. width. and color channels). The dimensions would be 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels). and there would be 4^3 or 64 components.

The indices here refer to the position of each component within the tensor. For example. you might reference the red color value of the pixel in the second row and third column as [2.3.1]. where '2' refers to the row. '3' refers to the column. and '1' refers to the red channel.

The size of this tensor would be calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions together. resulting in 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels) = 48. The shape of this tensor would be (4. 4. 3). describing the number of elements along each dimension.

Difference Between Rank and Dimension
While both terms describe the structure of a tensor. they represent different aspects. The rank is the number of dimensions. while the dimensions refer to the size (or length) of each of those dimensions. In the case of our 4x4 pixel image tensor. the rank is 3. and the dimensions are 4. 4. and 3.

Sample Log of a 4x4x3 Tensor
A 4x4 pixel image with three color channels can be represented as a 3D array (or rank 3 tensor). Each pixel's color is represented by a 3-element vector (for the three color channels). and the image consists of a 4x4 grid of such pixels. giving us a shape of (4. 4. 3).

A 4x4 pixel image with 3 color channels could be represented as a 4x4x3 tensor. like this:


tensor = [
    [  # First row of pixels
        [230. 10. 10].    # Red-ish
        [230. 230. 10].  # Yellow-ish
        [10. 230. 10].   # Green-ish
        [10. 230. 230]   # Cyan-ish
    ].
    [  # Second row of pixels
        [10. 10. 230].   # Blue-ish
        [230. 10. 230].  # Magenta-ish
        [220. 220. 220]. # Light gray
        [120. 120. 120]  # Gray
    ].
    [  # Third row of pixels
        [30. 30. 30].    # Dark gray
        [230. 50. 10].   # Different shade of red
        [230. 230. 60].  # Different shade of yellow
        [10. 60. 230]    # Different shade of blue
    ].
    [  # Fourth row of pixels
        [40. 230. 40].   # Different shade of green
        [50. 10. 230].   # Another shade of blue
        [230. 40. 230].  # Another shade of magenta
        [10. 40. 10]     # Dark green
    ]
]



Clearing the Confusion Around "Dimension"
The term "dimension" can lead to some confusion. In the context of tensors. "dimension" often refers to the depth of nested lists. not the geometric or mathematical space that a vector might represent. So. a vector like [3. 4] is a rank-1 tensor (or one-dimensional array) because it involves no nesting of lists. Its shape is considered to be (2.) because it contains two elements.

In summary. tensors. while initially appearing complex. can be demystified and understood through the step-by-step breakdown of their components and properties. As multidimensional arrays. they provide the foundation for manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning. making them a fundamental concept for anyone delving into these fields.

Exploring more properties of tensors
Understanding Covariance & Contravariance
A vector can be expressed in terms of its contravariant or covariant components

CASE 1: Expressing in terms of contravariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of components with basis vectors

üí°
We need 1 index for each of the components as there is only 1 directional indicator per component. 1 index. 1 basis vector. per component
If we decrease the length of the ‚Äúbasic vectors‚Äù (in a vector space). then the number of components required to make up a vector increases. Because the index & the number of components change contrary to each other. they are known as contravariant components of a vector Describing a vector in terms of these contravariant components (eg : 2 i + 3 j + 4 k) is how we usually describe a vectors


CASE 2: Expressing in terms of covariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of dot-product with basis vectorsIf we decrease the length of the basis vectors. then the dot-product decreases & vice versa. Since these properties are varying in the same way. we say that these are covariant components of a vector.


Specifying the notation for covariant & contravariant components


Now. say we take 2 vectors V & P

üí°
Index (for this rank 2 tensor. i.e. a vector) = unique combination of basis vectors
CASE 1: We multiply the contravariant values of V & P. On considering all possible ways. we get a matrix:

This will give us a tensor of rank 2 with 2 contra-variant index values. Here. each T value is called an element of this tensor. And since for each element. 2 indices (2 directional indicators are required) eg: Understanding by example. say we have a combination of 3 area vectors & 3 force vectors. To get the combination of all the forces on all the area vectors. for each such combination. we require 2 indices (i.e. 2 directional indicators ‚Üí 1 for the force & 1 for the area). We get 9 components. each with 2 indices (referring to 2 basis vectors)

What makes a tensor a tensor. is that. when the basis vectors change. the components of the tensor would change in the same manner as they would in one of these objects ‚Üí thus keeping the overall combination the same

What is it about the combination of components & basis vectors that makes tensors so powerful ‚Üí all observers in all reference frames agree. not on the components or the basis vectors ‚Üí but on their combinations. because they are the same

Index & Rank of tensors
üí°
Rank = the total number of indices = total number of coordinate systems (we need to have knowledge of to understand the location of the tensor) = total number of unique basis vector combinations = total number of unique linearly independent combinations = The total number of contravariant and covariant indices of a tensor.

The rank R of a tensor is independent of the number of dimensions N of the underlying space.
A tensor does not necessarily have to be created from vector components as is shown in these examples

A tensor of rank 1 is a ‚Äúvector‚Äù and has a number associated with each of the basis vectors. Only 1 index i.e. 1 combo of basis vectors is required to know the location


Here. \($V^1 = 5. V^2 = 3. V^3 = 2$\)


A tensor of rank 2 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 2 basis vectors


In a tensor of rank 3 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 3 basis vectors - composed of the components of 3 basis vectors. We can create different descriptions of this tensor by using different contravariant & covariant components of the basis vectors




More mathematical facts
While the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors. the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry. intended to represent physical space) . and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.
Objects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars. those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors. and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation. a vector v would be written $v_i$. where i=1. .... m. and matrix is a tensor of type (1.1). which would be written $a_i^j$ in tensor notation.
Tensors may be operated on by other tensors (such as metric tensors. the permutation tensor. or the Kronecker delta) or by tensor operators (such as the covariant derivative). The manipulation of tensor indices to produce identities or to simplify expressions is known as index gymnastics. which includes index lowering and index raising as special cases. These can be achieved through multiplication by a so-called metric tensor $g_{ij}. g^{ij}. g_i^j$. etc.. e.g..
Tensor notation can provide a very concise way of writing vector and more general identities. For example. in tensor notation. the dot product u¬∑v is simply written u¬∑v = $u_iv^i$ If two tensors A and B have the same rank and the same covariant and contravariant indices. then they can be added in the obvious way.
The generalization of the dot product applied to tensors is called tensor contraction. and consists of setting two unlike indices equal to each other and then summing using the Einstein summation convention. Various types of derivatives can be taken of tensors. the most common being the comma derivative and covariant derivative.
If the components of any tensor of any tensor rank vanish in one particular coordinate system. they vanish in all coordinate systems. A transformation of the variables of a tensor changes the tensor into another whose components are linear homogeneous functions of the components of the original tensor.
Tensors in the context of machine learning
The property of tensors to maintains its meaning under transformations is used also by machine learning. where real world data is transformed into corresponding tensors & then heavy calculations are done on these tensors to get valuable insights.

I used to just get so confused for understanding how do I actually incorporate a culture of powerful customer obsession that big companies like Amazon. Airbnb. Stripe speak so strongly about.

What does it mean? How does that change your workflow? What small optimizations can you do that can ensure you become such a company?

Yeah. you don't need a dedicated team for that - I want to list simple things you can do as a solopreneur in a garage as well.

Here's 4 learnings that I've had. from my current and previous startup. on how to build a reflex muscle for customer obsession. from 120+ overall interviews I've done.

0] an intro to the topic
Customer-centricity means you just know so much about the customer. that when you take decisions about product. you can tell exactly how your customers will react to it.

It's important because it builds very great relationship with them and they will stand by your team and product even when things don't work out that well.

1] 5hrs of talktime per week
If you're having less than 5hrs of talktime with customers. that means you either know everything about them or you need to find a different set of people to talk to. who're willing to spend time to discuss the problem.

Easy ways to get this:

Start by just asking your friends for people in their companies or families for a call and ask them to connect further. If you don't know anyone. just cold reachout your competitors' customers on Linkedin
Just ask for 25min calls. They seem shorter than 30 for some reason so I've seen people say yes and then give you the extra 5.
Ask them to not refer to "anyone". but "1 name" that they can think of - this is fast. and has 100% success rate.
Setup a communication channel on a platform they're most comfortable on. (Whatsapp. Telegram. Discord etc.) where you can just keep talking to them as friends
2] Less than a day of turnaround time
When you're a young company. you can provide near instanteneous customer support and that goes a long way in turning early adopters into evangelists. This is simple - just have them as priority notifications and swear you will reply something the moment you see a popup. Direct lines with founders who ping back quick feel very nice.

3] Organizing their feedback
This is the most important part. I'm sharing my company's template for this. It's just colorful stickies you can move around. but captures certain key snippets across multiple customers really well.

Just pick key sentences they say. tag and color them well - really helps a lot. Here's an example


At our company Recontact. we're helping people be amazing at building long-term relationships in professional and personal settings

Using this strategy. we figured out (check video) that "Maintenance" (i.e. keeping in touch with people) - was the most talked about point in our problem statement - because it had more stickies. And that realization saved us from spending 2 weeks worth of time in making "Search" in our app more efficient - because that's not what our customers cared about.

So yeah. that coloring and legend-making you did as a kid - well that's one of the key components in making a customer-centric business.

4] Building a muscle for the info
Revise. revise. revise. This. I learned from Apple CEO Tim Cook - who starts his day with reading random customer emails. Well. you can always read these stickies. Look into a simple analytics dashboard you can create for your app. - template link

You won't see it instantly. but. over time. a decision-making muscle gets built (very much like driving. music. fashion-sense) - that is very grounded in qualitative and quantitative analysis of customer feedback.

Listen to even the smallest details - you might not remember instantly. but then you'll be surprised how often you'll randomly remember a customer fact. when making a decision related to it.

In closing
You can be crazy passionate about this too - write customer snippets on your wall. listen to customer interviews at the gym. be thoughtful with delighting gifts. send personalized notes when their kids graduate etc. etc. etc.

Bottom line - Be close to the customer. even though the product will not work out. your company will. Business runs on trust and mutual respect.

"Social Capital" is simply the "network of relationships and acquantainces" that a person has developed over life".

We all hear fancy ass quotes about "making strong professional relations". "staying in touch with friends" and "your network is your net-worth". Here's a quick rundown of the best-selling way to build such social capital. since the past 80 years and beyond! Basically. become more likeable.

These are my key pointers from the book "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie. Each topic is its own tweetstorm - so kick back and read these wisdom snippets to help you build a strong people network.

With that let's dive in by understanding 6 ways to be a person who's good at making friends.

6 ways to make people like you
üí°
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
A dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love

You can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can. in 2 years. by trying to get other people interested in you

When you see a group photograph that you're in. whose picture do you look for first ?

It is the individual who is not interested in his/her fellow men/women who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring

You have to be interested in people if you wanna be a successful writer of stories

Can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them

eg : To call someone for an interview. write a letter first enclosing a list of questions that you except them to answer about themselves and their method of work

To find out someone's birthday ‚áí Begin by asking whether he/she believes the date of anyone's birth has anything to do with character or disposition

A show of interest. like every other human emotion. must be sincere

üí°
2. Smile
A smile says - "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you". That is why dogs make such a hit

A real smile. a heartwarming smile. a smile that comes from within. the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace

People who smile. tend to manage. teach and sell more effectively

Smile comes through in your voice

Hard work alone is the magic ¬†key that will unlock the door to our desires. People have succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. As the fun becomes work. people change ‚áí lose joy in it. leading business to grow dull and fail

Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Different mental attitude

Action seems to follow feeling but really. action and feeling go together and by regulating the action. which is under the more direct control of the will. we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not

Thus. the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there

Most folks are about as happy as they make up our minds to be

Picture in your mind. the able. earnest. useful person you desire to be and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual

A man/woman without a smiling face must not open a shop. It costs nothing but creates much

üí°
3. A person's name is to that person. the sweetest and most important sound in any language
The average person is more interested in his or her own name in all the other names on earth put together
Remember that name and call it easily. and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage
The executive who can't remember names can't remember a significant part of his/ her business and is operating on quicksand
Take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds
Most important ways of gaining good will is by remembering names and making people feel important
To recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion
To repeat the name several times during conversation and try to associate it with the person's features. expression and general appearance
Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices
Magic contained in a name should be realized as the single item. wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else.
The name sets the individual apart; it makes him/ her unique among all others
The info we are imparting or the request we are making takes on special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.
From the waitress to the senior executive herself. the name will work magic as we deal with others.
üí°
4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention
Dale Carnegie on listening and responding ‚áí Hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise
Good conversationalists are merely good listeners who encourage a person to talk
"Yes. and" - pay attention and show indications of it from time to time with approval or disapproval.
Important personages crave a good listener but ordinary folk do too.
"Many a person call a doctor when all they want is an audience"
If you wanna know how to PREVENT making people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you. here is the recipe :
Always listen to anyone for long
Don't talk incessantly about yourself
If you have an idea while the other person is talking. wait for him/ her to finish
People who talk of themselves think only of themselves
Those people who think of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. no matter how instructed they may be
People you might be talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems
Therefore. if you aspire to be a good conversationalist. be an attentive listener
üí°
5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests
Theodore Roosevelt used to sit up late the night before. reading up on the subject in which he knew the guest is particularly interested in
Road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he/ she treasures most
The reward is an enlargement of life each time you speak to someone
üí°
6. Make the other person feel important ‚Äî and do it sincerely
If we are contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get somethin out of the other person in return ‚Äî we shall meet with the failure that we so richly deserve
Attain the feeling that you have done something for him/ her without his/ her being able to do anything in return for you
The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated ~ William James
Do unto others and you would have others do unto you
Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you". "Would you be so kind as to ‚Äî?". "Won't you please ?". "Would you mind". "Thank you ‚Äî" little courtesies like these. oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday and. incidentally. they are the hallmark of good breeding
The power of honest appreciation is stupendous as everyone considers themselves imp
Every person I meet is my superior in some way ¬†~Emerson
Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
In conclusion
Be interested. smile. remember their name. listen more. talk about their interests and make them feel important. You nail that and you find yourself as a likeable. good friend who is connected to a lot of different kinds of people very well.

This is going to be a super fast guide for developers to leverage platform development tools with VR and build cool apps. Starting with just a laptop and a Meta Quest in your hand.

Here's what the final thing looks like:


Code
Here's the GitHub Repo containing all the code - https://github.com/CMU-SV-Ronith/sem_3pi

Introduction to VR and AI-Generated NPCs
Virtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we interact with digital environments. offering immersive experiences that blur the lines between the virtual and real world. One of the most exciting advancements in VR is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). especially in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with users in more human-like ways. This blog post delves into the creation of an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. highlighting the technological synergy of VR and AI.

Choosing the Right Engine
When embarking on VR app development. selecting the right engine is crucial. Two prominent engines are Unity and Unreal. After extensive research and testing. Unity emerged as the preferable choice for several reasons:

Ease of Learning and Accessibility: Unity uses C#. known for its simpler syntax and automatic memory management. This choice makes Unity accessible. especially for beginners and indie developers. unlike Unreal Engine's complex C++.
Asset Store and Community Support: Unity boasts an expansive Asset Store. providing numerous resources that speed up development. Coupled with an active community. developers have access to extensive support and shared knowledge.
Versatility in 2D and 3D Development: Unity's proficiency in both 2D and 3D development offers flexibility. allowing developers to work on various project types without switching engines.
Platform Support and Integration: Unity's broad platform support. including PCs. consoles. mobile devices. and VR systems. is vital for developers targeting diverse audiences.
Strong Documentation and Educational Resources: Unity‚Äôs comprehensive documentation and learning resources are invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.
Making API Calls in C# with Code-Walkthrough
We code in C# in Unity. Here's a simple video on integrating Unity App with C# code that you write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgUIx75fJ_E

This was used for the Speech Analysis and Text Analysis functions.

To integrate AI into our VR app. we need to make API calls. This is achieved through UnityEngine.Networking. setting up coroutines for HTTP(s) communications. The process involves getting and posting information. waiting for responses. and updating the UI to reflect changes. We utilize AWS for backend services and the Dolby Media Speech Analytics API for speech analysis.

The AnalyzeText coroutine sends a user's transcript to our backend for processing. while GetAnalysisResults retrieves the analysis. The AnalyseSpeech coroutine sends audio files for speech analysis. and UploadFileToS3 handles the uploading of files to AWS S3.

API connectors in the app
private IEnumerator AnalyzeText(string transcript)
        {
            var requestJson = new
            {
                prompt = transcript
            };

            var request = new UnityWebRequest(baseUrl + "/analyzeText". "POST")
            {
                uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonUtility.ToJson(requestJson))).
                downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer()
            };

            request.SetRequestHeader("Content-Type". "application/json");

            yield return request.SendWebRequest();

            if (request.isNetworkError || request.isHttpError)
            {
                Debug.LogError("Error: " + request.error);
            }
            else
            {
                string responseText = request.downloadHandler.text;
                // Display responseText in the UI
            }
        }
        private IEnumerator GetAnalysisResults()
        {
            var request = UnityWebRequest.Get(baseUrl + "/getResults");

            yield return request.SendWebRequest();

            if (request.isNetworkError || request.isHttpError)
            {
                Debug.LogError("Error: " + request.error);

This article is a refresher to anyone looking to build in sales - the current approach. terminology. key insights. challenges and opportunities available in this domain.


What is a sales funnel?
A sales funnel is the marketing term for the journey potential customers go through on the way to purchase. There are several steps to a sales funnel. usually known as the top. middle. and bottom of the funnel. although these steps may vary depending on a company's sales model.

A basic sales funnel can be described as consisting of 4 levels. Marketers can take inspiration from this basic structure to design a sales funnel that suits the needs of their organisation.

Awareness: At the very top of the sales funnel is the awareness stage that is populated by the largest number of people. These people. not quite ready to be prospects yet. have just had their first interactions with your company and its offerings. They don‚Äôt know much about your brand at this stage. but are aware that it exists.
Interest: The first interactions will hook some of these newly-aware people and draw them slightly deeper into the funnel. With their interest piqued. these people will spend some time getting to know more about your company and your offerings. They might browse your website or catalogue. read your blogs. or peruse reviews from past customers.
Consideration: Armed with knowledge gathered during the interest stage. your prospects will double down on their efforts to know your company and offerings better. They may reach out to your customer service team with specific questions. or fill out a form to access more information. Remember. by this stage they may have already compared your offerings to those of your competitors. So. it is important to clearly answer their questions and help them understand how your offerings can solve their problems or needs.
Negotiation and decision: The prospect has now almost decided to purchase your product or service. Depending on the nature of your offerings. they might begin a negotiation over the price. terms of purchase. or both. But it‚Äôs fair to assume that they have a purchase intention at this stage.
At the end of this stage ‚Äîthe prospect and seller have negotiated the terms of the sale to their mutual satisfaction. and the prospect pays the seller to officially become a buyer.
Extra - Renewal or repurchase: The sale stage is not the end of the sales funnel. Soon a time will come when the sales contract is up for renewal. The customer must now decide if they want to continue with the same seller. If so. there might be a fresh round of negotiations over price and purchase terms. followed by a renewal or repurchase.

Here's an image of the currently most widely used Sales tools and the stage of the funnel they're utilized in:


Why is a sales funnel imp?
That‚Äôs the value of knowing a sales funnel: Successful sellers understand the journey a prospect is likely to take before they buy. and can make sure they‚Äôre ready to move on to each stage. They‚Äôre focused on the buyer. meeting their needs in the moment and building trust that helps move the deal forward.

So what if you ditched the sales funnel? You‚Äôd run the risk of focusing too much on the close to hit quota. pushing products or services when prospects aren‚Äôt ready. Win rates would drop because prospects wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the solutions they‚Äôre offered. and trust would be lost. No long-term relationships. no cross-sells. or upsells.

What challenges does sales have in 2023?
Challenge 1: Standing Out From the Competition
To differentiate from others. salespeople should exceed prospects' expectations by being well-versed in their CRM and sales software. and staying updated with industry trends and news.
Today. SaaS companies offer personalised email marketing. educational content. and in-depth exploratory calls with experienced representatives. Therefore. if you want to stand out from the crowd. you must be one step ahead of the already high standards of helpful. inbound selling.
Gather sales enablement materials like industry specific demos. case studies. reviews. testimonials. and analytics tools or reports.
Keep up with industry news. trends. and reports to help prospects guide strategy and show the potential ROI to their supervisors or other decision makers.
Set up alerts and automation to help you follow up with prospects at the right time and provide valuable resources.
Existing tools - Apollo.io. Outreach.io
Opportunity: This presents an opportunity to innovate in personalized and inbound selling.
Challenge 2: Meeting Quotas
A sales representative's best strategy for achieving quotas and converting leads is to make phone calls - whether they are selling remotely or not.
2. Two thirds of salespeople also use discounts and promotions. and more than half report that they increase sales. The most popular promotion among sellers is bundling a suite of products. followed by free trials.

Challenge 3: Getting in Direct Contact with Decision-Makers
With remote work becoming prevalent. establishing a strong social media presence. particularly on LinkedIn. is crucial for connecting with decision-makers.
In 2023. 67% of sales representatives worked under a hybrid or fully remote basis. and globally. almost 70% of professionals worked remotely. Many leaders and decision makers have physically moved to new locations farther away from their headquarters as industry events have largely shifted to virtual and hybrid formats.
It's crucial that salespeople establish their own presence on social media if they haven't already done so. LinkedIn was rated as the most effective platform for prospect research by nearly three quarters of sales professionals.
Challenge 4: Lack of High-Quality Leads
The first place to look when dealing with lead quality issues is sales and marketing alignment. Having a shared understanding of the ideal customer profile or buyer persona for sales and marketing teams is essential.
Assess the lifetime value of customers and which ones turn into promoters in order to develop and update these assets.
Using tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. HubSpot Sales Hub. LeadIQ. and others. sales teams find and engage with prospects at the right time after identifying target customers.
Challenge 5: Keeping Prospects Engaged Throughout the Sales Process
It is important to understand your buyer in terms of the bigger picture context so you can keep their interest throughout the sales process. which can be lengthy depending on the software package or service you are selling.
It is common for sales representatives to communicate with prospects two to seven times during B2B and B2C sales processes. which adds up when considering that most work with dozens of prospects at once.
The use of automated sales management tools and CRMs with lead intelligence and logging of communications with prospects (such as phone calls. emails. and actions) can help sales teams manage hundreds of data points to successfully acquire new customers.
Challenge 6: Difficulty Getting Meetings With Prospects
Timing is everything. Reach out at the wrong time. you‚Äôre a nuisance. Reach out at the right time. and you‚Äôre the answer to a prayer. It‚Äôs well known in the industry that the best salespeople spend most of their time on calls with prospects listening.
In order to secure meetings with qualified prospects. the best strategy is to listen. And to make it easy to meet with you. When listening for signals that a prospect is ready to meet. use these questions as a guide:
Social selling requires a combination of social media savvy and sales tools that can automatically flag key readiness indicators and send automatic alerts.
Key insights from 30+ interviews with sales and growth teams
Over the past 3 weeks. with conversations over 30 sales people. here are the key insights that stood out from my learnings in the current approach:

Efficiency in Data Management: Many use tools like Excel and Salesforce for data organization. but there's a challenge in maintaining data hygiene and integrating personal notes effectively.
Personalized Customer Engagement: Sales reps emphasize personalized interactions. like remembering personal details about clients and customizing outreach. This includes tactics like social media engagement. client lunches. and gift-giving.
Utilization of Digital Tools: Sales teams heavily rely on digital tools like CRM systems. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. and calendar reminders for tracking client interactions and industry news.
Challenges with Remote and Hybrid Sales: Adapting to remote and hybrid sales environments is a notable challenge. affecting how sales reps connect with decision-makers and clients.
Importance of Relationship Building: There's a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships. seen as crucial in high-value sales.
Adapting to Market and Client Dynamics: Sales reps must adapt to changing client personnel and market conditions.
Efficient Use of Time and Resources: Balancing time spent on tasks like data entry and client engagement is crucial. especially in cold outreach and event networking.
Conclusion
In summary. the sales funnel remains a vital concept in the sales process. guiding potential customers from awareness to purchase.

In 2023. sales teams face challenges like standing out from the competition. meeting quotas. and effectively engaging with decision-makers. particularly in remote and hybrid work environments.

Utilizing digital tools like CRMs and LinkedIn. focusing on personalized customer engagement. and maintaining efficient data management are essential strategies. Building strong relationships and adapting to market dynamics are key to navigating these challenges.

Sales teams must balance innovative selling techniques with the efficient use of time and resources to succeed in the evolving sales landscape.

This blog is from notes from an amazing talk at the OpenAI DevDay conference by Colin Jarvis and John Allard. Here's the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y)
In the realm of natural language processing. optimizing large language models (LLMs) is a formidable challenge. Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity. The performance of LLMs. often abstract and difficult to measure. requires a nuanced approach to optimization. In this blog. we‚Äôll explore a mental model of options for LLM optimization and develop an appreciation for which option to use and when.

You will leave with a foundational understanding of the two axes of optimization‚Äîcontext and LLM behavior‚Äîas well as a practical guide to the nuanced world of model refinement.

The Twin Axes of Optimization

1. Context Optimization
At its core. context optimization is about fine-tuning what the model needs to know. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:

Prompt Engineering: As the lower-left quadrant in our optimization matrix. prompt engineering is your fast lane to setting a baseline. Start by refining the prompts you feed into the LLM and observe the performance changes.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Positioned in the upper-left. RAG introduces more context. Begin with simple retrieval mechanisms. and consider fine-tuning for a more nuanced approach.
2. LLM Behavior Optimization
LLM behavior optimization delves into how the model should act. The two main strategies are:

Fine-tuning: The lower-right quadrant represents fine-tuning. which customizes the LLM‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks.
Comprehensive Approach: Sometimes. a combination of all methods is required to reach the desired performance level. An example would be integrating HyDE retrieval with a fact-checking step.
The key is to start somewhere. evaluate. and then iterate with another method.

Strategies Explored
Prompt Engineering: The Starting Block
Starting with clear. concise instructions and breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks is paramount. Giving models "time to think" and testing changes systematically can yield surprising improvements. Extending this by providing reference text and using external tools can further enhance the results.


When It Shines:

Quick testing and learning
Establishing a baseline for further optimization
Its Limitations:

Introducing new information
Replicating complex styles or methodologies

Retrieval Augmented Generation: Expanding Knowledge
By giving LLMs access to domain-specific content. RAG helps update the model's knowledge and control the content it generates to reduce inaccuracies.


When It Shines:

Introducing new. specific information
Controlling content to reduce errors
Its Limitations:

Broad domain understanding
Learning new languages. formats. or styles
Enhancing RAG:

Employ retrieval with cosine similarity and HyDE
Experiment with FT embeddings and chunking
Implement reranking and classification steps
Evaluating RAG:

On the LLM side. consider the faithfulness and relevance of the answers.
On the content side. assess the precision and recall of the context retrieved. More data does not necessarily equate to higher accuracy.

Fine-tuning: The Custom Tailor
When prompt engineering doesn't cut it. fine-tuning may be the right path. Continuing the training process with domain-specific data can optimize model performance and efficiency. For example. Canva leveraged fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to produce structured output. showcasing the power of high-quality training data.


When It Shines:

Emphasizing existing knowledge
Customizing response structure or tone
Its Limitations:

Injecting new knowledge into the model
Quick iterations on new use-cases
Steps to Fine-tune:

Data preparation
Hyperparameter selection and loss function understanding during training
Evaluation with relevant test sets and expert opinion
Fine-tuning Best Practices:

Start with prompt engineering
Establish a clear baseline
Prioritize quality over quantity in training data

The Combined Approach: Fine-tuning + RAG
Sometimes. a blend of fine-tuning and RAG yields the best results. This method allows the model to understand complex instructions with minimal tokens. creating more space for retrieved context and leading to a more robust performance.




Practical Application
The real-world application of these strategies can be as creative as generating hypothetical answers to enhance similarity searches. For example. initial baselines might yield a 69% performance rate. while a RAG with a well-crafted answer could increase that to 84%. comparable to fine-tuning. Collaborations. such as the one between Scale AI and OpenAI. demonstrate how a combined approach can optimize models to new heights of efficiency and effectiveness.


Careful what you fine-tune on
In conclusion. maximizing LLM performance isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It requires a toolkit of strategies‚Äîfrom prompt engineering to fine-tuning and beyond‚Äîeach with its own set of benefits and best-use scenarios.

there needs to be a part of education that allows students to dream and tinker and take risks. Something that makes them laugh and cry and hope and bond and stay up late in teams and chase self-assigned deadlines and ship something they would have never thought they could.

that was the ideal of buildschool.

we wanted to give students "an ecosystem of believer-builders who built things to solve problems because they wanted to". and having friends around always helps.

but the issue was. we were targeting a student base who had just come back from remote learning. who was not entirely immersed into this tinkering culture and was more driven by definite career paths.

in April 2022. Technical Society (TechSoc) started with minimal funding. full motivation and targeted growth hacks. to grow a strong community. I think the best takebacks from this journey are perseverence. dealing with ambiguity. and faith in the dreamers of tomorrow.

and our approach at TechSoc has always been - invest in the team. invest in the participants and invest in the future. here's 3 stages of how we built a community from scratch and run it well. to this day.

üí°
This journey was only possible due to the amazing contribution by Anouksha Hemanth. Prabhat Bedida. Subham Sagar. Yashaswi. Piyush Agrawal. Nikshay Jain. Vishwajeet. GK Harish and several others who made this vision real.¬†
building a team
first. we had to make team buildschool believe that the mission they were solving was important because they would be enablers of a movement much bigger than themselves. so Anouksha and me used YCombinator's startup school curriculum and actually had each manager at buildschool study startup from a perspective of product strategy. history. revenue and future steps. this helped them understand how products are built. gain confidence in talking more about these ideas and also be better thinkers in general. over 2.5 months we did multiple startup teardowns. had these people practice cold emailing founders and speaking comfortably with them. here are some of their early day case studies.

once our little army was ready. it was time to go to war. boy. was it going to be brutal.

inspiring a community
the early days were very random and we had barely any clue of processes and contacts and pretty much anything. we were just very clear on what we had to solve - get 10 student prototypes. not powerpoints. out by the next 13 weeks.

to begin with. the issue was. how do you even get people to care to solve problems? it was always cooler to do fancy PoRs that add sure-shot resume points as opposed to taking a bet on whether you and your buddies could build something or not

and even if people do care. how do you get them to actually learn this process of product building - right from design. to shipping to release to iteration and beyond? well. the answer actually lies in inspiring people.

as Simon Sinek says. if you connect with the "why" of people. you can truly move them to do unbelievable things. and we did all sorts of crazy things to get the message across. here's a video from the early days. just a whiteboard. an ai generated thumbnail and some students talking about a crazy vision of 10 teams. 10 weeks. 10 prototypes.


we did speak to people and touch upon a nerve.

to further this. we revived the history of the "fun in building" through our alumnus Kedar Kulkarni - who started off with very realistic stories of moving up the quality ladder by building computer vision fun-tools with his friends and then moving up to govt partnerships and funded projects. looking back. i think that may have struck a really strong chord - even in me.


something to remind students of where the foundation of innovation lies
sustaining the experience
10 teams selected. basic application on their plan for 10 weeks. we were just looking for grit.

to refine our teams. buildschool organized really amazing talks right from product research and UI designing. all the way up to engineering and growth post launch. we got CXOs and industry veterans to give talks for free - how did we do that? well. we just connected with the "why" of these disruptors through a cold email as simple as:


the thing that sold best was the thought of inspiring students to build more
boom! 7 high quality lectures in various domains - all conducted at zero cost. well. except for the food. it does not have to be complex - ¬†

growth hack - give people free food and they show up the 1st time. give them a memorable experience and they will keep showing up again and again.


give them pizza and they'll do amazing things
and it was hard. students want to do all sorts of things at all times. so we used accountability partners called "build buds" for each team to navigate through getting the right resources. connected to the right folks. and even actually finishing right before deadlines.

guess what - at a mini demo day amongst the teams - 9 of them had a functioning product! here's a random picture from the mini demo day at the 8 week mark.

investing in the future
by the time the 10th week ended. teams had transformed beyond what we had thought. people who didn't know coding had built apps. people who were shy on stage were presenting. people who were unsure about their passions had picked up something new and built something meaningful out of it. well. and the buildschool team - they had gone through the extreme rollercoaster of 0 attendee events (that really happened. it was really stressful) to having a great turnout of 9 products built in those 10 weeks and then we came for a repeat in the upcoming semesters with even more student interest. what makes me smile the most. is that people actually now think of this as a thing they can do full time.


end of buildsprint #1. november 2022
fun fact. one team even got incubated in the startup accelerator at IIT Madras. i look forward to more such stories.

‚≠êÔ∏è here's my takeaway - atleast once in life. i feel. every person must go through the pain and the fulfilment of building something from 0 to 1. because once you're on the other side of the storm - you gain the self-confidence to do anything you want.

that's what our vision at techsoc always has been. cheers and happy building!

Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart is a fantastic tool to deploy machine learning models. In this blog. we'll walk you through the process of using Jumpstart to deploy a model named "Llama2" and expose it as an API endpoint using AWS Lambda functions.

Step 1: Set Up SageMaker Domain and User
Begin by navigating to the Amazon SageMaker service in the AWS Console. Here. create a domain and user profile. This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.

Step 2a: Deploy the Llama2 Model
After setting up your domain and user. head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the "Sagemaker Jumpstart" section. and from there. choose to deploy the "llama 7b model." This process usually takes about seven minutes. and at the end of it. you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this. as it will be essential for the next steps.

Step 2b: Integrating any Huggingface Model with Amazon Sagemaker
Instead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options. you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how

1. Setup development environment
We are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.

import sagemaker
import boto3
sess = sagemaker.Session()
# sagemaker session bucket -> used for uploading data. models and logs
# sagemaker will automatically create this bucket if it not exists
sagemaker_session_bucket=None
if sagemaker_session_bucket is None and sess is not None:
    # set to default bucket if a bucket name is not given
    sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()

    
    
def setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=None):
    """
    Params:
    - default_bucket: Default bucket name to use for the session

    Returns:
    - session: SageMaker session object
    - role_arn: ARN of the IAM execution role
    """
    global sagemaker_execution_role
    session = sagemaker.Session(default_bucket=default_bucket)

    try:
        sagemaker_execution_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
    except ValueError:
        iam = boto3.client('iam')
        sagemaker_execution_role = iam.get_role(RoleName="sagemaker_execution_role")['Role']['Arn']

    return session. sagemaker_execution_role

def mask_account_id(account_id):
    return '*' * len(account_id)

def main():
    sagemaker_session_bucket = None

    session. sagemaker_execution_role = setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=sagemaker_session_bucket)

    # Mask it
    account_id = sagemaker_execution_role.split(':')[4]
    masked_account_id = mask_account_id(account_id)
    masked_role = sagemaker_execution_role.replace(account_id. masked_account_id)

    print(f"SageMaker role ARN: {masked_role}")
    print(f"SageMaker session region: {session.boto_region_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC
Compared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker. we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend. session. region. and version. You can find the available versions here

from sagemaker.huggingface import get_huggingface_llm_image_uri


## Fetch docker image URI for the Hugging Face DLC:
# 1. backend name
# 2. Hugging face LDC version


# retrieve the llm image uri
llm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri(
  "huggingface".
  version="0.9.3"
)

# print ecr image uri
print(f"llm image uri: {llm_image}")

Hardware Requirements
Llama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B. 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.

Note: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.

MODEL	INSTANCE TYPE	QUANTIZATION	# OF GPUS PER REPLICA
Llama 7B	(ml.)g5.2xlarge	-	1
Llama 13B	(ml.)g5.12xlarge	-	4
Llama 70B	(ml.)g5.48xlarge	bitsandbytes	8
Llama 70B	(ml.)p4d.24xlarge	-	8
Note: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning. e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.

These are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B. 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks. we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances. since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.

It might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.

# confirm requirements met for kernel
import json

def get_instance_type_from_metadata():
    with open('/opt/ml/metadata/resource-metadata.json') as f:
        metadata = json.load(f)
        resource_name = metadata.get('ResourceName'. '')
    return resource_name

def main():
    resource_name = get_instance_type_from_metadata()

    # List valid instance types
    valid_instance_types = ['ml.g5.12xlarge'. 'ml.g5-48xlarge']

    if any(instance_type in resource_name for instance_type in valid_instance_types):
        print("Instance configured correctly")
    else:
        print("Need to upgrade to at least 'ml.g5.12xlarge' instance")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
4. Deploy Llama2 to Amazon Sagemaker
To deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id. instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type. which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.

Note: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.

import json
import getpass
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel


def get_sagemaker_config():
    # sagemaker config
    instance_type = "ml.p4d.24xlarge"
    number_of_gpu = 8
    health_check_timeout = 300

    # Define Model and Endpoint configuration parameter
    config = {
      'HF_MODEL_ID': "meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf". # model_id from hf.co/models
      'SM_NUM_GPUS': json.dumps(number_of_gpu). # Number of GPU used per replica
      'MAX_INPUT_LENGTH': json.dumps(2048).  # Max length of input text
      'MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(4096).  # Max length of the generation (including input text)
      'MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(8192).  # Limits the number of tokens that can be processed in parallel during the generation
      'HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN': getpass.getpass("Enter your Hugging Face hub token")
      # .'HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE': "bitsandbytes". # comment in to quantize
    }
    return instance_type. health_check_timeout. config

def create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. image_uri):
    # check if token is set
    assert config['HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN'] != "". "Please set your Hugging Face Hub token"

    # create HuggingFaceModel with the image uri
    llm_model = HuggingFaceModel(
      role=role.
      image_uri=llm_image.
      env=config
    )
    return llm_model


def main():
    instance_type. health_check_timeout. config = get_sagemaker_config()
    
    # Set role and image_uri
    role = sagemaker_execution_role
    llm_image_to_ref = llm_image
    
    # Declare llm model with create_hugging_face_model module
    llm_model = create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. llm_image_to_ref)
    
    # Deploy model to the endpoint if llm_model is available
    if llm_model:
            llm = llm_model.deploy(
                initial_instance_count = 1.
                instance_type=instance_type.
                container_startup_health_check_timeout=health_check_timeout
            )
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
5. Run inference and chat with the model
5. Run inference and chat with the model
After our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:

temperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.
max_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20. max value is 512.
repetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. defaults to null.
seed: The seed to use for random generation. default is null.
stop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.
top_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null. which disables top-k-filtering.
top_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling. default to null.
do_sample: Whether or not to use sampling ; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.
best_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs. default to null.
details: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.
return_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.
truncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.
typical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.
watermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.
You can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation

The meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:

[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>

{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]

We create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt. which converts a List of "messages" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.

def build_llama2_prompt(messages):
    startPrompt = "<s>[INST] "
    endPrompt = " [/INST]"
    conversation = []
    for index. message in enumerate(messages):
        if message["role"] == "system" and index == 0:
            conversation.append(f"<<SYS>>\n{message['content']}\n<</SYS>>\n\n")
        elif message["role"] == "user":
            conversation.append(message["content"].strip())
        else:
            conversation.append(f" [/INST] {message['content'].strip()} </s><s>[INST] ")

    return startPrompt + "".join(conversation) + endPrompt
  
messages = [
  { "role": "system"."content": "You are a friendly and knowledgeable vacation planning assistant named Clara. Your goal is to have natural conversations with users to help them plan their perfect vacation. "}
]
# define question and add to messages
instruction = "What are some cool ideas to do in the summer?"
messages.append({"role": "user". "content": instruction})
prompt = build_llama2_prompt(messages)

chat = llm.predict({"inputs":prompt})

print(chat[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Now we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.

# hyperparameters for llm
payload = {
  "inputs":  prompt.
  "parameters": {
    "do_sample": True.
    "top_p": 0.6.
    "temperature": 0.9.
    "top_k": 50.
    "max_new_tokens": 512.
    "repetition_penalty": 1.03.
    "stop": ["</s>"]
  }
}


# send request to endpoint
response = llm.predict(payload)

print(response[0]["generated_text"][len(prompt):])
Step 3: Integrate with AWS Lambda
With your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand. navigate to AWS Lambda. Here. create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:

import json
import boto3

ENDPOINT_NAME="jumpstart-dft-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b"
runtime= boto3.client('runtime.sagemaker')

def lambda_handler(event. context):
    data = event["body"]
    print(data)
    
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME.
        ContentType='application/json'.
        Body=data.
        CustomAttributes="accept_eula=true"
    )
    
    response_content = response['Body'].read().decode()
    result = json.loads(response_content)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200.
        'body': json.dumps(result)
    }
Step 4: Grant Necessary Permissions
For your Lambda function to work correctly. it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions. create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17".
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0".
      "Effect": "Allow".
      "Action": "sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint".
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
Step 5: Expose Lambda Function as an API
Once your function is ready and permissions are in place. expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.

Step 6: Testing Your Deployment
To test the setup. use a curl command. like the one below:

curl --location 'https://khhg37edhrmibhj4ahsxqnqlha0qoqqc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "inputs":"I believe the meaning of life is".
    "parameters":{
        "max_new_tokens":256.
        "top_p":0.9.
        "temperature":0.6
    }
}'
This command sends a POST request to your Lambda function. which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.

In Conclusion
Setting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process. It offers scalability and ease of integration. making it suitable for a range of applications. For more detailed steps and best practices. you can refer to this official AWS blog.

Executive Summary
Virtual Reality (VR) is poised to revolutionize education by offering immersive learning experiences. Mel Slater's 2016 research emphasizes VR's potential for implicit learning. making abstract concepts tangible and enhancing understanding. Platforms like Bodyswaps. combined with Oculus VR headsets. promise innovative soft skill training. The booming VR market. projected to reach $165.91 billion by 2030. testifies to its growing influence. Comprehensive research objectives have been outlined. focusing on long-term effectiveness. personalization. inclusivity. cost implications. and device efficacy. The research aims to ensure VR's effectiveness and relevance in the rapidly evolving professional world.

Problem Selection
1.1 Statement
Virtual Reality (VR) offers a transformative approach to education. expanding the boundaries of traditional learning. Mel Slater's 2016 paper. "Implicit Learning through Embodiment in Immersive Virtual Reality." elucidates this potential by delving into the concept of implicit learning. where individuals acquire knowledge without conscious awareness (Slater. 2016). VR's immersive nature is largely attributed to two illusions: Place Illusion (PI) and Plausibility Illusion (Psi). PI gives users the sensation of being in a virtual environment. leveraging the body's natural perception methods. while Psi makes events in VR feel authentic (Slater. 2016). The sense of embodiment. where one's physical body is substituted by a virtual counterpart. enhances this immersion.

1.2 Understanding the Potential
The educational potential of VR is highlighted by its ability to transform abstract concepts into tangible experiences. Instead of mere observation. students can actively participate. visualizing and manipulating realities that would be otherwise challenging or impossible in the physical world. Such hands-on experiences advance explanations and deepen understanding (Slater. 2016). The incorporation of VR in education also shifts the pedagogical paradigm. placing students at the focal point of instructional attention.

Another study examining the efficacy of VR in K-12 and higher education found VR-based instruction significantly impacts various learning outcomes (Effectiveness of virtual reality-based instruction). Factors like learning outcome measures. type of learning tasks. and feedback mechanisms moderate the effectiveness of VR instruction. suggesting a tailored approach to VR integration can yield optimal results.

The expanding VR market. projected to grow from $25.11 billion in 2023 to $165.91 billion by 2030. underscores its burgeoning influence (TAM). Specifically. the VR education segment is expected to reach a valuation of $46.14B by 2027 (SAM). Such growth is indicative of VR's increasing integration in diverse sectors. including education.

Moreover. the unique data potential of VR. as seen in a 2023 study where motion data allowed researchers to identify users with over 94% accuracy. promises personalized learning experiences. enhancing user engagement and facilitating predictive analytics. Such data-driven insights can quantify skill development. bolstering stakeholder confidence and paving the way for novel monetization strategies.

1.2 On Bodyswaps and Meta
Bodyswaps. a cutting-edge VR training platform. specializes in honing soft skills through immersive simulations. enabling learners to practice. receive feedback. and even view their interactions from another's perspective. This innovative approach to learning facilitates deep introspection and skill enhancement. When integrated with Meta's Reality Labs' Oculus VR headsets. users can experience Bodyswaps' transformative training in a seamlessly immersive environment. The synergy between Bodyswaps and Oculus could redefine soft skill training. making it more accessible. effective. and in tune with the digital age's demands. This partnership promises a future where learning transcends traditional boundaries. merging technology with human-centric education.

1.2 Reflection
Virtual Reality (VR) is revolutionizing the educational landscape by transcending traditional learning boundaries. Slater's 2016 research highlighted the immersive potential of VR. emphasizing implicit learning and embodiment. The integration of VR into education promotes experiential learning. making abstract concepts tangible. The booming VR market. expected to reach $165.91 billion by 2030. emphasizes its growing significance. Moreover. platforms like Bodyswaps. when combined with Oculus VR headsets. promise innovative soft skill training. blending technological advancements with human-centric educational approaches. The future of learning seems to be at the cusp of a VR-driven transformation.

Understanding the data
2.1 Insights from current data
The current data offers a multitude of insights. Personalization is at the forefront. with data distinguishing between identified and anonymous users. potentially facilitating targeted feedback. Device-specific data can elucidate how different hardware affects user experiences. Furthermore. module-specific IDs enable segmentation based on the soft skill being trained. The diverse range of event verbs and time-stamped data illuminates user interactions and pace of learning. respectively. The metadata's complexity offers an opportunity for detailed event analysis. while the "context" field provides both structured and intuitive data analysis. The grading system in the 'Scored' event can provide immediate feedback. and the data under "conversed" and "said" events can be pivotal in analyzing user decision-making patterns. The presence of the "segmented" event also hints at the platform's capability to conduct A/B testing. fostering continuous module improvement.

2.2 Where is VR most effective
VR's efficacy shines in scenarios demanding an immersive experience. such as public speaking or job interviews. where environment and ambiance play a pivotal role. It excels in behavioral training. especially in modules like "Active Listening" or "Inclusive Leadership." enabling users to practice interpersonal interactions in a controlled setting. Additionally. VR proves highly beneficial in feedback-driven scenarios. For instance. modules like "Navigating Microaggressions" can benefit from VR's ability to simulate intricate social situations and deliver instantaneous. data-driven feedback.

2.3 What Student Demographics?
Young Adults/Recent Graduates:
Beneficial for those entering the workforce.
Modules such as "enteringTheWorkforce" and "jobInterviewSkills" are particularly relevant.
Mid-Career Professionals:
Modules like "Inclusive Leadership" and "Navigating Microaggressions" cater to those aiming for leadership roles or professional growth.
Diverse Backgrounds:
The system captures demographic data. including gender and racial group.
Opportunities exist to examine training effectiveness across various demographic segments.

2.4 What are Attitudes Towards VR for Soft-Skill Development?

Futurecasting. - or the art of envisioning the unforeseen. is a crucial skill in our dynamic world where the tide of events can shift unpredictably. Our perception plays a pivotal role in determining how we steer our ship into the future.

Mental Maps and Perceptions
As individuals. we need to acknowledge that our understanding of the future is inevitably tinted by personal perceptions and biases. not objective truths. Each person's mental map. the internal framework we use to navigate decisions. varies. and these maps significantly influence the decisions made regarding the future.

The Risk of Success
Ironically. success might be one of our biggest stumbling blocks. Past triumphs can make us overly reliant on the mental maps that brought us to our current position. A strategy that yielded success in the past isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work indefinitely. and overconfidence in these tried-and-tested mental maps might blind us to other possibilities and opportunities.

The Pitfall of Incorrect Maps
As the legend goes. the first set of Spanish voyagers actually thought that there was a water body connecting south-west and north-west coast of USA. And they made a wrong map. with full confidence. not knowing their mistake. Fun fact. until 16 years. voyagers used the wrong map and after multiple complaints. they were finally able to break the mental model of the government to actually update the map. And that process took 160 years total. The story of the erroneous map of the USA. used for 160 years due to stubborn belief in its accuracy. serves as a telling example. An incorrect understanding leads to misguided actions. and once a particular map (or belief) is accepted. altering it becomes a formidable challenge.

Asking Uncomfortable Questions
Futurecasting is not about comfort; it's about preparedness and openness to disquieting truths. It requires us to challenge our convictions and ask questions that make us squirm. This process involves thinking divergently about what lies ahead. questioning the mental maps we hold dear. and being willing to redraw them as needed.

Navigating with Awareness
Much like skilled sailors navigating the waters with an acute awareness of tides and winds. individuals and organizations need to craft strategies with a deep understanding of global currents and shifts. Where you eventually land is a result of both your goals and the global factors that either facilitate or hinder your journey.

Case in Point: The Oil Business

A look at the oil industry. where success is traditionally measured by rig count. reveals a critical mistake. Businesses often take one scenario. tweak it slightly. and convince themselves that they are working with different models. However. slight variations of a single view do not capture the diversity and unpredictability of the real world.

Learning from IBM

A picture from forecasting by an IBM leader. saying that PCs weren't a good enough market
IBM‚Äôs monumental miscalculation of the PC market potential‚Äîestimated at a few hundred thousand dollars. while the real value was a staggering $30 million‚Äîcost them dearly. The mental maps of their strategists. albeit successful in the past. failed to envision a scenario where PCs would be ubiquitous. missing out on a colossal opportunity and leaving an estimated $200 billion on the table - $100 billion for the software OS (Windows. then called MS-DOS) and $100 billion for the chip making market (that Intel captured)

Scenario Thinking: An Essential Tool
To prevent these decision traps. scenario thinking is invaluable. It helps to mitigate overconfidence. encourages outside-in thinking. enables seeing the full picture. corrects problem framing. and promotes asking the right questions. The goal is not to predict the future accurately but to ask better. more insightful questions. to prepare for a variety of possible futures.


Conclusion
Futurecasting. therefore. is a dance between confidence and humility. knowledge and curiosity. planning and flexibility. It's about continually asking "what if" and being prepared to redraw your mental maps to navigate the thrilling. unpredictable. and often unthinkable tides of the future. Let's escape the confines of our minds and be open to the vast. exciting possibilities the future holds.

Checkout this comprehensive analysis of various stakeholders. factors and strategic outcomes - link

If the very essence of employability is threatened then isn‚Äôt it important to talk about it?
And this time it is different. We talk about how technology shifts have been there. but this time its different. Today there are 78 million jobs that are vulnerable to be automated (IMF Report. 2021). And not enough non-routine. cognitive jobs being created (62mill) to fill this unemployment. gap(IMF Report. 2021). And lets take today‚Äôs discussion to talk about how this unfair wealth battlefield can be given its justice. It is currently important to study how this divide is ‚Äúcreated strongly due to technology‚Äôs impact on employability‚Äù.at this point time - and prepare ourselves for an ambiguous future

1. Job Displacement due to Automation
Automation has pierced through not just manufacturing sectors. but a vast array of industries. radically transforming the employment landscape. Far from being limited to routine and repetitive tasks. modern technological tools are expanding into spaces we once believed were uniquely human: content generation. graphic design. music composition. and even video editing.

Data Snapshot: Forecasts warn that a staggering 800 million workers worldwide could find their roles obsolete by 2030 due to automation. Furthermore. an alarming statistic states that 60% of all occupations have at least 30% of tasks that can be automated. signifying the breadth of the potential impact.
2. The Daunting Skills Gap
The velocity at which technology is advancing presents a conundrum. On one end. there's a surge in tech-centric roles. while on the other. there's a glaring skills deficit. This gap is even more pronounced among certain demographics: the elderly. individuals in rural settings. those encumbered by responsibilities. people with disabilities. immigrants. refugees. and professionals in non-tech domains.

Data Snapshot: The World Bank's 2020 report on the digital economy illuminated the magnitude of this disparity. noting that a mere 1% of Africa's workforce possesses ICT skills. Moreover. Deloitte's findings underline this crisis. with 64% of employees believing their organizations are unprepared to bridge this skills chasm. Adding fuel to the fire. only 17% of institutions are confident about having a future-ready workforce.
3. Escalating Income Inequality
The technological boom has inadvertently created a rift between high-skilled tech aficionados and low-skilled workers. As the former group reaps the benefits of a tech-driven economy. the latter. especially those susceptible to automation. grapples with stagnating or diminishing wages.

Data Snapshot: As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. the wage gap between those armed with a college degree and those with just a high school education has been expanding. The United Nations' ITU highlights another facet. pointing out that a lack of access to digital tools and the internet exacerbates income inequality.
4. Concentration of Wealth: The Tech Elites
It's undeniable that the tech era has given birth to a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals. This isn't just about riches but also the power and influence that come with such immense wealth. from influencing political decisions to shaping economic policies.

Data Snapshot: 2021 data reveals that the collective wealth of global billionaires skyrocketed to over $10 trillion. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. the ten wealthiest individuals added a colossal $450 billion to their coffers. To put this disparity into perspective. the top 1% of the global populace controls more than 44% of the world's wealth.
5. Gig Economy: Freedom or Feudalism?
The gig economy. bolstered by technology. promises flexibility and autonomy. Yet. it's essential to ponder whether it's a genuine avenue for empowerment or merely a modern form of feudalism. where workers. despite being 'connected'. remain isolated and vulnerable.

Data Snapshot: The gig ecosystem has witnessed explosive growth. with 36% of the U.S. workforce engaged in gig roles. cumulatively contributing to a market valued at $204 billion.
In synthesizing these insights. the digital age emerges as a paradox. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. it simultaneously casts shadows of inequality and uncertainty. As we navigate this era. it's paramount that stakeholders ‚Äì from governments to corporations to educators ‚Äì work in tandem to ensure that the digital future is inclusive. equitable. and just.

I did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software. This blog would be the story and the specifics of what a lot of people have asked me over the years. about how I made the switch and some things that you can use too. if you're interested in the same

I'll keep a major part of this blog very generic to the topic "switching streams" in general and then I'll add a section. at the end. about things I did.

Continuous learning is the name of the game
Today. learning anything is completely possible. at any given point. if you're willing to put in the work.

A lot of times we're under the notion that only a few people can learn a skillset based on the course they're "officially" enrolled in or some background experience they've had. I don't believe so. I think. that in this all-knowing YouTube and ever-improving-chatGPT era - anyone can learn anything from the Internet - for free. at their pace and convenience and from tonnes of world leading tutors.

Here are some pointers that might help you:

There is no magical playbook - to learn anything. it takes a lot of time and persistent effort of finding the right material for yourself and creating a roadmap for improving in the skill. So it's fine if you're not having a clear path to start with. There are a couple of channels that can give a clear path. but I think. that just starting from a Google or YouTube search about the topic name is a good place to start.
Taking notes really helps - Even if it's rough screenshots. scribbling random thoughts while learning or just copy-paste's of youtube videos - it works. I'm currently exploring YouTube video summarizer plugin in ChatGPT for this purpose. What's even better is revising and refining notes - for smarter reference later. It's like creating a power pellet from your learnings that you can consume at any point in the future to catch up on the skill super-fast. I used Notion for organizing whatever I've learnt into easily reference-able notes.
Motivation is 2/3rds of the game - Dedicate a fixed time slot for learning and keep struggling to make the most of it. Have very little ego. Initially you might suck - that's cool. But after breaking your head for about 1-2months. you'll not even realize but you'll naturally start seeing patterns and connections. That's the next level.
You shouldn't be afraid to suck at something new and give up if you struggle across even when understanding a paragraph of a new topic. Hell. when I was learning programming. it took me about 12hours to fully grasp and implement a 5 min youtube video about animation. But then. relentlessly pursuing on and on and on. I was able to condense 12 hr worth learnings into 5mins of revision through my notes. It's going to be hard. but if you just stick with it. it's going to be worth it.

The world is project-driven
We live in a fast paced world where most teams just look for how much value an individual can add to their team. If you've independently taught yourself and built impactful projects. no one really cares about your background coming from.

This can be harvested well to your benefit if you want to even your odds with those. who are already in the stream you like. Just build projects that rival with them. And these days YouTube has walkthroughs of any project across any stream for free - it's just so good.

Here are some key pointers to help you in this leg:

Projects are strong applications of learning - Project can mean anything - a tiny robot. a sketch. a basic app. a research paper commentary. a spreadsheet. ¬†a 5sec musical composition. a youtube video - anything. Point is - you're supposed ¬†to have employed your learnings and you're supposed to have worked super hard. It will help grasp the reason of each thing you thought was dumb but you read anyways and help translate it into moving parts of something very impactful
Start by copying other people's work - A good place to start is searching for existing projects on the internet and interpreting and recreating their work. Painters. musicians. writers. chefs - do it all the time while practicing - just patiently learning from the experience of others. This would help avoid pitfalls and learn best practices from your teachers. Again - don't just blind copy as they do. Refer - understand - try to recreate - fail - go back to refer- then understand - then try to recreate and so on.
Add your own flavor to each project - Employ a personalized touch to your project so that its unique. In the early days. I liked reading so when I came to programming projects - I would just add quotes of my favourite personalities in them as my touch. Now for you. it can be anything you like. but once you do this. you just differentiate extremely well from every other person who's just blind-copying and give a polished overall outcome
Tie the project to your ego - I get why this might be a double-edged sword but hear me out. Once you set a benchmark for the finished expectations from a project - tie it to the fact that it's something the world will see as a finished project from "you" and hence it can't fall below a certain quality threshold. For me. it used to motivate me to always push the project to completion and have it satisfy some baseline criteria.
Learn and grow with stakeholders - Some projects. you might not do alone and hence the coolest thing would be to learn from your collaborators and ensure they have a good experience working with you. Believe it or not. people and team skills are still one of the most important virtues for any team. Have fixed meetings. track your progress. hit your metrics and note down and share - what each of you learnt from the project. Projects offer collaborative opportunities and hence you can learn much beyond the books and the internet - you learn from people and in a lot of ways - what you learn will surprise you.
The more you passionately employ your learnings into real-time applications the more strongly your education will stick to you. ¬†

How to sell yourself
The next step after building projects is to share your work with the world and capitalize on it.

Few pointers on this are:

Have an online gallery - Every time you learn something. it would really help if you could maintain a online browsable gallery of your work. Be it your GitHub page or Dribbble gallery or LinkedIn profile or blog page. Just everytime you wrap up learning something. create an online snapshot for the world to view your thinking. approach. knowledge depth etc.
Look for interesting people and DM them: I used LinkedIn. Each time I found a person with interesting work - I would DM (Direct Message) them on LinkedIn and if possible. even get on a call to understand how they thought and learn from them. Seriously. it helps so much to get other people's feedback on your approach. Beyond this. there are obviously interesting conferences that you can just boldly sign up for. attend and be the newbie who talks and learns from everyone.
Confidence is free: In the early days in this new stream. you'll often feel imposter syndrome and underconfident - so start pretending otherwise. With time. it will grow into something more solid and with the knowledge and experience piling on. it would just compound. Confidence also helps express passion and clarity for the subject matter so the more you are confident about your projects and subject matter. the more people would value your work
I guess that about sums it up - in a nutshell - randomly search for ways to learn. iteratively keep sucking till you get better. build toy projects that make you happy and confidently talk about them on platforms. Rest. I'm 100% sure. the journey you take will help you figure out.

My story
Alright. now I'll be more specific about my story and things I did. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. thinking that a good college. a good job would be the only salvation. So naturally. once I got into the 4 year Civil Engineering program at IIT Madras. I thought that this would limit me from pursuing anything lateral. But in this internet-learning driven age. that's hardly the case.

To find what I liked - for a year. I dated a lot of career options - photo and videography. standup comedy. automotive engineering. consulting. designing. architecture and many countless others - mainly through hanging with different clubs of students in my college. ¬†Once I stumbled upon "software startups" I've just felt an irresistable pull to it. that stands to this day. Obviously there are a lot of days where I've doubted it too. but if it's your calling. some part of you always knows and gets attracted to it.

Now the specifics okay. I'll make it pointwise and list specific instructors and courses so that you can maybe check them out:

Disclaimer: You don't have to do it like me. Just read my opinion and do it the way most apt to you :)
I learnt the basics of programming in C Language from the hard copy book - How to C. by Prashant Kanetkar. It took me 4 months with my other college work helps understand the foundation of how a piece of code is designed. written. interpreted and executed.
Next 4 months. I learnt web development (HTML. CSS. JS) from DevEd. WebDevSimplified and Brad Traversy. I also use Laith Harb for time to time learning of new skills. Also. I used to build a lot of toy projects that these youtubers would post walkthrough videos of - this udemy course of 20 projects with Javascript is pretty sweet - link. Also learnt Git during this time
I used to also pursue first 2 hrs of any random long 7-8hr videos from FreeCodeCamp's youtube channel - anything from Data Structures and Algorithms to CyberSecurity to even color designing. I even did a bit of digital illustrations from from Gary Simon.
After this. I was consuming content and courses very fast. In the next 2months I learnt NodeJS. ¬†React and TypeScript. GraphQL. Docker and other misc topics. These are the most common industry technologies in use these days.
I even learnt basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and some Systems Designing from Algoexpert. A good place to start learning the basics of literally anything programming or computer related is Fireship - who does amazing 100second video intros of a tech.
From time to time. I've flirted with Machine Learning and AI courses from DeepLearning. ZeroToMastery and random blogs and projects and stuff. But these 2 sources are very strong for it
Next up. I was having trouble deploying apps and understanding large scale software so I studied systems designing from Gaurav Sen since it helps fall in love with the strength of computing. I also completed certifications from AWS. Google and Microsoft with the help of Stephane Mareek's amazing content
In fact. I feel that Stephane Mareek's course on Cloud Computing is a must-do for any software engineer to appreciate the beauty of internet and all cloud services that become the strong backbone of it. Just do this course. trust me.
Yeah and after that I got into generalist mindset and I was brushing up on everything from Figma for designing to Flutter for app development and was tinkering with over 10 frameworks and DevOps products at any given point for building great software.
To start getting more professional experience. I used to always offer myself up as a cheap developer to startups. I remember cold reaching out to 200+ engineers and founders (not HR since they have less of a say in hiring than actual engineers who lead teams) on linkedin over 4 months before I landed my 1st internship.
In startups. ¬†I could learn a lot everything about businesses - in the high-growth-vacuum environment that startups offer. Plus I made some money. re-invested that back in random tech-courses and business-books that I used to pick like a kid at a candy store and kept building and building a 2nd brain of mine in Notion.
I kept up my spirit and did create projects entirely from scratch on my own right after the 1st 6months even though they felt shitty and didn't work as well. Some. I couldn't even afford to keep running cause I would have to enter credit card details and I didn't have one back then. So I created YouTube videos or blog posts and shared the code as I sunsetted each project deployment. You can find a log here - link. Point is just keep trying honestly.

2nd brain in Notion
Yeah and after that I tried to run my own software startup. made some money and I failed to run it long term (here's the story of it - link).

I balanced all this work with college. Fun thing is. once you do projects. everyone wants to give you a shot - be it professors looking for programmers or startups looking for part-time developers.

A lot of times. people ask me how I managed my time or remembered so much. I do not. I just used "Google Calendar" and practiced using a lot of tools to keep reminding me to meet my goals and do my things. Every night before I go to sleep. I plan my next day's calendar for 10mins to be a good student. programmer. student-club head. brother. son. friend or any role that I feel is important dedicating my time to. Recently I even started to take Mondays to plan 3 to 4 most important things I wanted to achieve in each sphere of life in that week - like learning to cook. or reading a book. finishing an online course. deploying a project. teaching my mom about tech or even learning to play squash or salsa dancing with my friend - I tracked it all so I knew if I was missing out on time for any of my commitments.

My academics did take a hit no doubt - but I knew that I wasn't giving enough time to it and why I wasn't so it was cool.
Recently. I ended up applying to Carnegie Mellon University.

It took me a lot of research and advice - and I made this document to put down my thoughts. goals and opportunities - link. This was the single most important thing I did before choosing what I wanted to do next. I showed this doc to my seniors. people I knew and respected. family and friends and finally collated their advice into a decision.

For applying. here's all I did:

I gave the GRE test (325/340 with 4.5 in essay writing) and TOEFL test (111/120) though I didn't think GRE would have much weightage now. People say you gotta take paid courses and prep for 5 months and I don't believe it. Just mark your calendar. Go through this free material I aggregated in 2022. for GRE and TOEFL and you'll be able to get it done sooner.
Next. I talked a lot about my projects in my SoP. I wrote about majorly. creating impact through startups and software. you can give it a read - link.
My CGPA in academia was 8.01 out of 10 in my undergraduate college. I willingly didn't study as much in class or in pen-paper exams. But I pursued projects passionately and that's where I caught up on.
For Letters of Recommendation - 1. I got from the CEO/Founder 1st startup I worked with for 9months. Next. a letter from a Computer Science professor in my undergraduate whom I helped for free as a DevOps engineer on his logistics project. back in my 3rd year. I got my 3rd reco letter from my favourite Computer Science professor who had taught me 1 course (and that too I didn't score that well XD). but he just looked at my profile and work and decided to give me a shot. And yeah. that's where sometimes just asking gets you to. I just wrote him (and other profs too) an email and he called me for a 20min meeting and decided to help me out
I guess with all of that. I'm now headed for a Masters in Software Management to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I've messed up a lot. Have done a tonne of random things and kept exploring. Some of it worked. Most didn't.


In the end. I just have 1 advice - read a lot of opinions to expand your world view but at the end. internalize all that info with with what feels right in your heart. and trust me. just fuck it and do it.

Here's just a basic email thread exchange I had with 1975 passed-out alumni of Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) - exchanging talks about the way things are at IITM right now in 2023 vs in 1970. What ensued were views about IIT Madras and India in the 1970s. This is a fun anecdotal blog that tells 2 stories from different ages and how. from studying what happens in India's colleges. we can study the broader outlook of technological progress in the nation

1970s
Following is the message from an alum - Sudhir Krishna who passed out in the 1970s

B.Tech was a 5-year program. ¬† Half of the first year was spent toiling in the workshops wearing khaki uniform. ¬† The curriculum was course-heavy: ¬†Usually had 7 courses per semester. and reached 8 courses in the 7th semester (4th year). ¬† Continuous contact hours from 8 AM to 4:15 PM (with lunch from noon to 1:15 PM). ¬† ¬†Not much free time for creative projects except in the final (10th) semester. ¬† ¬†The German collaboration was still evident and some German faculty were still around. ¬† The campus population (students. faculty. administrators. staff) was much smaller than it is now. ¬† ¬†We all had single rooms in hostels. ¬† The annual cultural festival Mardi Gras was started and has now become Saarang (right?). ¬† ¬†Students were multi-talented -- academics. music. chess. bridge. quiz. drama/ acting. mimicry. sports. literary activities. etc. ¬† I myself was captain of the institute chess team. member of the institute tennis team for a couple of years. won the institute debate contest one year. represented IIT-M at the cultural festivals of other IITs. and became Under Officer in NCC Air Wing.
Also. back in the 1970s. India was still a poor country with a socialist economy. ¬† The country's global image was associated with poverty. backwardness. ¬† Only some American universities and companies were aware of the IIT brand. most notably Harvard Business School (where I got my MBA) and management consulting firms like McKinsey. ¬† Even back then. HBS admissions officers said they viewed IIT B.Techs the same way they did MIT and Caltech undergrads. ¬† But they made fun of Indian typewriters that were used for completing the application forms

I received an invitation from McKinsey for an interview that began with "Because of your Indian Institute of Technology background......."

2023
I recently graduated from IIT Madras. The hostel sector is quite lush with trees starting to form canopies above. The monkeys are not only more in number now. but more in daring as well. They're smart. bold and know how to work the system to get what they want.

The academics are strong and flexible with students having the option to pursue whatever they want. irrespective of their BTech department. A lot of application and project based courses have sprung up where we do assignments and mini-projects as opposed to just written exams.

Students are a lot in number now and it's fun to see everyone put honest hard work in their passions - right from technology and sciences to art. music. comedy and gaming. You find people of all interests and talents. The labs and workshop are still hands-on. though only about 40% of what it used to be in the 1970s. The departments have also developing into independent schools of specialization on their own with tonnes of activities. projects. lectures. events. yearly festival and more. In fact. the new department called "Engineering Design" - (near Velachery Gate) offers a lot of product designing and entrepreneurship encouragement in both- ¬†hardware and software. There's the department for management studies. humanities and flexibility of leveraging online platforms like NPTEL (https://nptel.ac.in) apart from attending in-person classes.

Here's my favourite part - the student-run project lab - Center for Innovation at IIT Madras - has over 20 teams and a 2 storey cool building. each one tinkering in topics all the way from AI. robotics. app development and racecar engg to energy efficiency. rocketry. product designing and rural tech (check this for more - https://blog.techsoc.iitm.ac.in/tech-iitm-in-5-mins/). So I'd say recovering from the pandemic. projects are at a powerful high

Hostel culture also seems to be re-igniting. guess a lot of it got hit during the pandemic years but teams like Schroeter. LitSoc and TechSoc are putting the fire back in. Athletics is strong and we won 1st in Men's championship and 4th overall in Inter IIT Sports Meet. We bagged 6 medals in Inter IIT Tech Meet (Golds in AI and entrepreneurship) and came 3rd in Inter IIT Cultural Meet.

In a nutshell. IITM has become the perfect home for pursuing anything passionately
Speaking of animals - monkeys are ruling the hostels so much so that we get a complaint email about monkey assault every week or 2. They're bold and smart and compete for food. ¬†The deer and blackbuck population is also fair and we do hangout with them in lawns sometimes. Dogs were actually moved out of the campus in 2019 since they used to hunt deer. There's a species of red ants we see all the time and snakes are barely spotted once or twice a year during rains. if anytime. Funnily. scorpions are seen near admin buildings and hostels sometimes
Workshops are lighter and we have much more time for creative activities. If you can think of it. there's a club for it working passionately.
On nearby places - Right now. Taramani is still go to for tea. snacks and cigarettes and food delivery orders. There are 2 cycle repair shops in insti. We get great breeze. most likely attributed to the greenery since the construction has blocked out the sea breeze. Student's these days hang out mostly around a huge mall outside Velachery. the food shops along the 100 ft. Road outside Taramani. Elliot's and Marina beach. Chetpet Eco-park this place called "Hidden Lake". Tada waterfalls in Andhra. and Westin bar (if you have money :)). But insti itself is I think the most happening place for so many technical. sport and cultural things that folks barely step out.
On innovation- Self-innovation and Entrepreneurship is being spearheaded by the new Director - Professor Kamakoti. In collaboration with Indian government. Professor Prabhu Rajagopal and his team - is doing several things to help students build products and eventually. companies. In fact. a couple of companies like Ather. HyperVerge. Solinas Integrity - born right inside IIT Madras - are making waves. Most recently Clueso got funded by YCombinator in 2023 and it furthered more students to do this.
On inside insti ¬†- The Dhaba outside Saras is now a full-fledged restaurant with all kinds of Indian food. juices and snacks. It's currently managed by the caterer - Zaitoon - but the tender is open for bids every 3 years. We had to recently monkey proof it due to the stealing incidents XD. The first floor of this is converted into a colorful place with a large television screen for student clubs to sit and ideate. Mummy Daddy Andhra mess outside Taramani is our go-to place for Biryani. Our tuition fees. without scholarship. are now INR 1.00.000 and hostel fees is INR 26.000 for each semester. The hostel bonding. as Srikanth said. is more shifted to clubs and messes are detached from hostels. This has helped in knowing a lot more breadth-wise bonding.
A lot of construction is going on now. There are 2 new Academic complexes. And a new sports complex is being made near the tennis courts
IIT Madras is a lot more creative. entrepreneurial. ¬† Its population is much larger. ¬† The post-graduate programs have grown a lot. ¬† Admissions quotas based on caste and gender have made the student population more diverse. ¬†(We had very few women during our time.) ¬† The IIT brand name is now world renowned. but still based largely on its undergrad B.Tech program and not yet for post-graduate and research programs. ¬† IIT alumni have distinguished themselves in America and reached the highest levels in industry and academia.

Also. India as a country has changed. ¬† It is capitalistic. entrepreneurial and technologically advanced. ¬† The country's nominal GDP is world #5 and projected to become world #3 by 2028. ¬† PM Modi. in my opinion. is a superstar on the global stage and gets royal treatment wherever he goes. ¬† Geopolitically. India is viewed as a counterweight to China. ¬† This is shaping up to be a China-India century and will be very evident by 2050. ¬† As for IITs. there are 23 of them now. ¬† While the 5 original IITs still rank at the top in India. some of the newer IITs are establishing niches of excellence for themselves. ¬†IIT Madras is ranked at the top.

Attaching a couple videos and pictures of campus here for your reference
Checkout these videos:

Campus tour - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUfsG5xQnuU








Fruit juices are still cheap. Canteens still open till 3am. Sunlight still glitters through trees. Students still mess around but have that drive to innovate and lastly - friendships are still stupid and meaningful.

I recently graduated from Indian Institute of Technology. Madras. Here's 8 lessons I learnt from my 8 semesters and stories of how I learnt them so this is not some lame vanity post.


July 2019. entering college
Semester 1: It's a big world and trying everything. even lying outside your comfort zone is free. Be open to talk to everyone and make tonnes of friends. Semester 8 will teach you why its important. I picked up this lesson while borrowing 300 from a hostel guard to pay for pizza at 3am. attempting failed jokes at open mics and also while countlessly sitting in club orientations. It's always a good time to suck at new things :)


Semester 2: It's college. you can sign up for tonnes of things and asking anyone for help is free - people genuinely want to help. I learnt this while being disciplined and trained by the legends of the Raftar Formula Racing team as we championed 3 national trophies against all odds. Discipline and accountability take passion and convert it into wonders.


Semester 3: Just build projects that teach you skills you find cool. Persistence and hard work will help you trump all odds to be good at what you love. Maintaining motivation is 2/3rds of the game. Sitting in a COVID ridden world. using my neighbour (Jay Bafna's) WiFi to learn software development and making dumb projects like todo apps taught me that just inching a little closer to ambition. Preferably start an online presence of you that tracks your work well - write about your work and share


Semester 4: At this point. I'd say start taking bets on yourself and bold risks is the best - you're young - what's the worst that could happen? I learnt this core lesson when I decided to leave home and work at Farmako (YC S20) with a different set of legends. Having very little resources and pure hunger to survive and succeed over 9 months taught me a lot about the brilliant impact a small determined set of people can have on the world. Be stupid. take more bets. You're young and smart - you'll figure it out


Semester 5: You'll see a world of people who seem to have figured it out and gotten it right. But most of us are just winging it. I'd say at this point. just being real with a couple friends and still believing and taking bets is the hard path. I personally learnt it through shit tonne of mistakes. self-doubt and pain and tears that 2 things in life mattered - I was working on something I cared about. and I was around people I loved. I follow this principle to date. Not caring about a lot of external stimuli is a superpower you can acquire by just self-assessing.


Semester 6: You're growing now. Tension is building up and you're probably expected to have figured out life. You don't. In fact it's a good thing if you've failed over 3-4 times by now - it means you're trying and getting back-up enough. Having a vague idea of how you want to spend time - that's something I'd recommend having. A good idea here is take up something. and no matter how much it pains. see it through completion. Working with Logistics Lab. IIT Madras and Coursepanel taught me that enduring and reaching the finish line is way more important than procastinating for perfection or giving up midway. That's a major differentiating factor too.


Semester 7: You're probably multi-tasking at this point. Become boring. routine-driven - use a calendar and documentation tools to string multiple tracks together. Write a lot - it helps unclutter the mind and think clearly. I know it's boring but having control over how your time. energy and money flows by writing stuff down goes a long way. It helps aim long for a year and piece it down to what you and your team need to do today. I learnt this while helping Institute Technical Society (TechSoc). IIT Madras frame its vision from to 1700+ participants. 14 events and countless projects. I learnt that small tasks with directed effort moves mountains.


Semester 8: It's your turn to give back now. Now your old friendships will blossom and it's time to be ready for new ones. Be there as a mentor your junior self would have appreciated. Preferably take up a position of responsibility that's undervalued and difficult and lead a team through and through. no matter what it costs. I think the Inter IIT Technical Meet at Indian Institute of Technology. Kanpur where we went from stranded on a railway station to nailing medals in Kanpur (2000 miles away) in under 40 hours.


Most lessons are not my own and have been taught to me by amazing amazing mentors. friends. family members and I'm undeniably grateful to.

This blog won't solve your problems - hell. mine also took a fuckload of meanderings before I got to understand them. Think of it as more like - not repeating my fuckups. College is a mix of confusion and opportunities. wins and losses - in a short time frame so screw everything and feel free to ping me anytime if you're going through something and need a ear. Listen to all this - but the best part is - don't do it like me. do it like you. üòâ

Machine Learning projects may seem complicated at first glance. but in reality. they follow a systematic flow that. once understood. makes the whole process quite straightforward. In this blog. we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.

Let's first sing a song to kickoff this blog


In a nutshell. what are we gonna talk about
It's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section. I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead. I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!


Steps of ML
0. Become One with the Data
The initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data. identifying potential outliers. and understanding the relationship between different variables.

1. Preprocessing Your Data
Raw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning. normalization. and standardization of values.

When dealing with large datasets. it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as "batches". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor. and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.

2. Creating a Model
Starting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A "baseline" is a relatively simple. existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress. you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.

3. Compiling and Fitting the Model
Once you have decided on your model. the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function. optimizer. and the evaluation metrics. After compiling. fit your model to the training data. allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.

4. Evaluating the Model
After your model has been fitted. it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
In order to improve the model's performance. you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.

Remember. overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting. consider using techniques such as data augmentation. regularization layers. or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.

6. Iterate Until Satisfied
The above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.

8. Explore Advanced Techniques for Improvement
Once you have beaten your baseline. you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model. training for a longer period. finding an ideal learning rate. using more data. or using transfer learning.

Deep Diving into templates and tricks
Processing the Data
The first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it. thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data. where actions such as rotating. flipping. and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.

Shuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset. such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training. consider shuffling your data.

When processing your data. you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:

StandardScaler can give each feature zero-mean and unit standard deviation.
MinMaxScaler provides a non-distorting. light-touch transformation.
RobustScaler is useful for reducing the influence of outliers.
Normalizer provides row-based normalization. using l1 or l2 normalization.
Refer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.

Start with a Baseline
Starting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:

Creating a model: Define the input. output. and hidden layers of a deep learning model.
Compiling a model: Define the loss function. optimizer. and evaluation metrics for the model.
Fitting a model: Train the model to find patterns between features and labels.
Baseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. based on your project's requirements.

PyTorch
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Set the number of epochs (how many times the model will pass over the training data)
epochs = 100

# Create empty loss lists to track values
train_loss_values = []
test_loss_values = []
epoch_count = []

# Put data on the available device
# Without this. error will happen (not all model/data on device)
X_train = X_train.to(device)
X_test = X_test.to(device)
y_train = y_train.to(device)
y_test = y_test.to(device)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    ### Training

    # Put model in training mode (this is the default state of a model)
    model_0.train()

    # 1. Forward pass on train data using the forward() method inside 
    y_pred = model_0(X_train)
    # print(y_pred)

    # 2. Calculate the loss (how different are our models predictions to the ground truth)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred. y_train)

    # 3. Zero grad of the optimizer
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # 4. Loss backwards
    loss.backward()

    # 5. Progress the optimizer
    optimizer.step()

    ### Testing

    # Put the model in evaluation mode
    model_0.eval()

    with torch.inference_mode():
      # 1. Forward pass on test data
      test_pred = model_0(X_test)

      # 2. Caculate loss on test data
      test_loss = loss_fn(test_pred. y_test.type(torch.float)) # predictions come in torch.float datatype. so comparisons need to be done with tensors of the same type

      # Print out what's happening
      if epoch % 10 == 0:
            epoch_count.append(epoch)
            train_loss_values.append(loss.detach().numpy())
            test_loss_values.append(test_loss.detach().numpy())
            print(f"Epoch: {epoch} | MAE Train Loss: {loss} | MAE Test Loss: {test_loss} ")
Tensorflow
# Now our data is normalized. let's build a model to find pattern

# Set a random seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# 1. Create a model
model_2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28.28)).
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4. activation="relu").
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10. activation="softmax").
])

# 2. Compile the model
model_2.compile(
    loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy().
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam().
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# 3. Train the model

    train_data_norm.
    train_labels.
    epochs = 10.
    validation_data = (
        test_data_norm.
        test_labels
    )
)
Plotting training and testing loss
## Plotting training and test loss

# Plot the loss curves
plt.plot(epoch_count. train_loss_values. label="Train loss")
plt.plot(epoch_count. test_loss_values. label="Test loss")
plt.title("Training and test loss curves")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.legend();
Evaluating Our Model
Visualizing our model's predictions and its performance metrics is an integral part of model evaluation. Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems. evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.

Tracking Experiments
Visualizing our model's predictions
Apart from that. a good way to proceed is visualize. visualize. visualize!

It's a good idea to visualize

The data - What data are we working with? What does the data look like?
The model itself - what does our model look like
The training of a model - How does a model perform as it is learning?
The predictions of the model -How do the predictions match up against the ground truth (the original labels)
To visualize our model's predictions. it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values

def plot_predictions(train_data=X_train. 
                     train_labels=y_train. 
                     test_data=X_test. 
                     test_labels=y_test. 
                     predictions=None):
  """
  Plots training data. test data and compares predictions.
  """
  plt.figure(figsize=(10. 7))

  # Plot training data in blue
  plt.scatter(train_data. train_labels. c="b". s=4. label="Training data")
  
  # Plot test data in green
  plt.scatter(test_data. test_labels. c="g". s=4. label="Testing data")

  if predictions is not None:
    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)
    plt.scatter(test_data. predictions. c="r". s=4. label="Predictions")

  # Show the legend
  plt.legend(prop={"size": 14});
To efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations. it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.

Improving Our Model
Build the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....

Improving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation. compilation. and training stages.

During the model creation stage. you might add more layers. increase the number of hidden units in each layer. or change the activation function. In the compilation stage. changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.

This process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as "hyperparameter tuning".

Approaches to improve accuracy

Get more data -> Get a larger dataset that we can train our model on
Hyperparameter tuning -> Use more hidden layers or increase number of neurons in each hidden layer
Train for longer -> Give your model more of a chance to find patterns in the dataset
Save a Model
Saving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment. like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow. depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch. the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().

PyTorch code
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Create models directory 
MODEL_PATH = Path("models")
MODEL_PATH.mkdir(parents=True. exist_ok=True)

# 2. Create model save path 
MODEL_NAME = "01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth"
MODEL_SAVE_PATH = MODEL_PATH / MODEL_NAME

# 3. Save the model state dict 
print(f"Saving model to: {MODEL_SAVE_PATH}")
torch.save(obj=model_0.state_dict(). # only saving the state_dict() only saves the models learned parameters
           f=MODEL_SAVE_PATH)
Run on GPU
Running your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function. where device is set to "cuda" for GPU or "cpu" for the Central Processing Unit.

Conclusion
In conclusion. understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively. Remember. machine learning is an iterative process. and it's okay to go back and forth between steps to improve your model's performance.

Introduction
As we progress in the age of digital transformation. organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework. an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda. is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management. which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless. and how does it function? In this blog. we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.

What is AWS Serverless Framework and How is it Helpful?
The Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes. either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda. you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.

Installing Node.js and Python on Your MacOS Machine
Before we start with the Serverless framework. we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.

To install Node.js. we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:

brew install node

For Python. MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However. it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:

brew install python

To verify successful installation. type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.

Setting Up AWS and Serverless CLI on MacOS Machine
After installing Node.js and Python. it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:

npm i -g serverless

Upon installation. verify the version using serverless -v command.

To deploy your functions on AWS. you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command. replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin

How to Invoke. Deploy. and See Logs of Serverless Lambda Functions
To create a new service or function. use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example. to create a Python service:

sls create --template aws-python --path myService

To deploy this function to AWS. use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only. use sls deploy function -f functionName.

To test a function on AWS. use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.

What is AWS SAM and How to Set it Up on MacOS
AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions. APIs. databases. and event source mappings.

To install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS. first. install the AWS CLI:

brew install awscli

Next. install AWS SAM:

brew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli

Initialize a new SAM application using sam init. choose your desired runtime (e.g.. Python). and template. To build your application. navigate to the project directory and use sam build.

You can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API. you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.

To deploy your application. use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke "FunctionName".

If you need to delete your stack for any reason. you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.

You can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode. click on "Add Debug Configuration" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.

For Python packages management. you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.

Conclusion and Why Serverless is Useful for Cost-Saving
As you can see. the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating. deploying. and managing serverless applications. Moreover. by leveraging these tools. we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.

Serverless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage. it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions. which leads to significant cost savings. especially for applications with variable workloads.

We hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.

TechSoc IIT Madras was one of the most stressful and fulfilling decisions I made in my last year in institute. We upscaled the tech culture at the institute through organizing 20+ competitions. 15+ guest lectures - resulting in 22
products. events impacting 2000+ students. I‚Äôd personally recommend this to any person who shares these 2 traits -

passion of driving a solid tech culture at our university
willingness to test their limits to stand for something bigger than themselves
I‚Äôll talk mainly about 6 things about my tenure as TechSoc Head from 2022 to 2023. where we captured the engagement of over 2000+ students. having conducted 15+ guest lectures and 20+ technical events.

The Initiatives
The Experience
The Growth
The De-merits
A crazy story
Cool stuff I got to do
FYI - Although this blog is all motivational stuff. we failed a tonne of times. but we did end up making people smile and make amazing things - and that's what it's all about.

The initiatives
My approach was and always has been - invest in the team. then invest in the customer and then invest in the future. The fun part about this 3 step process is the more you invest in the earlier phases. you're actually also investing well enough in the latter parts.

Investing in the team
The most important part was always that each member on the team felt proud and challenged and happy about the work we did. They had to grow. they had to be happy and challenge their own problem solving skills - else it wasn't worth it.

So here are a couple things I tried and liked:


not the full team. some suckers missed picture day
A training period
Spent atleast a month for new joinees to get used to "entrepreneurial activities" - like studying companies. making presentations and pitching. drafting detailed reports. running collaborative projects. cold emailing. corporate relations. This helped the team learn a lot in a short period of time and gain confidence.

Here's a syllabus if it helps - link

But yeah. if you want top-quality. hard-working. smart people actually working with you on your vision - gotta train your army to fight. You can start by defining the vision of your team. and what culture you want to carry into this.

Meeting structuring
College is a complex time with lotta priorities. commitments and spontaneous plans. It is important to have a definite meeting structure so that you stay consistent and add a punctuality aspect to respect everyone's time.

If anyone came late. they bought ice-cream to everyone who came before.
If the meeting didn't end on time. then I would buy ice-cream for everyone in the meeting
Every meeting had a document and actionables that people could take back so we always met with a direction. discussed agenda as per time and walked away with usable data and direction.
This structure is something I learned from Sharavanakumar at Khatabook and to this day. I'm grateful for it.

OKRs
OKRs - helping break down the overall vision into just 3 things each of the 18 of us had to get right each week - while working with each other. We were 18 disruptors - 54 things per week. pointing in 1 direction - helped us grow like crazy.

Team Happiness and Culture
At TechSoc. you always get a birthday cake. If you're in person - team folks even show up for your celebration at 12AM. We ensured that in our weekly retros. we had shoutouts for everyone who did great work in that week. Every event we saved on. the surplus would go back to team treats and gifting goodies. We were transparent about our money and trusted each other with it. Apart from that. we'd enjoy late night sessions on the lawns playing games (Mafia. Truth and Dare. "Albatross") or singing or sharing stories about ourselves.

Investing in the experience

give them pizza. they will build amazing things
Every event at TechSoc was a collaboration with another technical team on campus. And they're usually busy with projects but do want the publicity on campus. Every meeting we had with them. went as follows:

Why are we doing this event? What do we want to takeback from it
What does the event do? What's the best date and why?
How will the overall flow of conducting look like?
How do we market it?
What do we need (human resources and props) to run it successfully?
What are some loopholes we should consider when organizing this?
Metrics tracking and SWOT analysis
All this information would then be captured in a document - sample. This document would contain all the plan. the necessary links and people collaborating on it.

On ground. here are some values we ensured each time we conducted the event

Participant is god. If it means you're cycling with one hand and doing repeated samosa deliveries. sticking posters everywhere or ensuring that they have water - you gotta do it.
TechSoc never gives up. No matter how much things screw-up. And they did. like. all the time. Once there was an internet issue in a seminar we were streaming while a billion dollar CEO waited on the other end. But we recouped and did the damn thing
After-event work happens super fast. Everything from prizes. to score updation. to social media. website updating and everything.
Investing in the big picture

Mandakini hostel team. who made a car that did obstacle detection realtime
"Always build on top of your previous work". A lot of what we did at TechSoc compounded in on itself over time. We started with arguing and justfying INR 7000 rupee budgets for paper plane events and in 1 year got to INR 1.5 lakh AI hackathons. The way to do this was:

Update the fricking website - ensure that the overall presence of TechSoc was always up to date with everything that we had achieved so other people could review. With time. as we did more things. we became more awesome and it kept compounding with time. This helped get external attention and investment as well.
Build extensive documentation - Every document. going in. with time. created such a strong clarity and database - everything from important contacts to event documents and plans and costs and the whole thing - just mind-blowing. It helped a lot of people collaborate and introspect and evolve work with time.
Align everyone. Repeatedly - Every meeting. or party. or failure point - it was super important to just tell everyone what we stand for.
The Experience
Technical Society is a relatively growing student body and so the job is obviously hard. The place my team had to start from was how to even get 5 people to show up for an offline event when we were reeling back from the pandemic. Key points of my experience are:


the aero contingent team from our university (L to R - Akshat. Ayush. Pranit. Reddy Anna. my Alak boi. Sukriti)
It‚Äôs a fricking rollercoaster - There are events that go super well and then there are others where 0 people show up. My highs were really high and lows were equally painful. I‚Äôve wanted to quit and dump so many times but then there were equally balanced nights of euphoria and adrenaline
It‚Äôs about the team- Investing in the team‚Äôs growth during the summer following my recruitment was one of the best decisions I made. Because this strong loyal team stood while we encountered multiple hits over failed early events in the first semester. And now I see the same shy-to-even-turn-on-their-video-camera students stay up 14 straight hours. jugaading food and leading the conduction of tech events on campus.
Diplomacy is everything - I‚Äôve had to be nice in multiple f-you conversations and taken a lot of sit from multiple participants and stakeholders at a lot of points. Being rational more than emotional. knowing the right words to pitch to the right decision maker for an approval. collaborating with other student bodies for mutual vision alignment - that kind of thing
The tech community has heart - Tech-community is introverted. reserved and fit the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù description (barring a few outliers). But these are the same people who will pour their heart out for finessing a project - right from scribbling on whiteboards to presenting products. stand by and help each other for free. bond over late night tea conversations and pizzas. fight when they‚Äôre sleep deprived and drive real impact to push the society forward. This inspirational set of people is worth fighting for
The Growth
Gigantic network - This is the most golden essence of being in an technology college. I reached out far and wide:

interacted and connected with the most passionate tech enthusiasts across all domains at my university
connected to nationwide college's top talent through a joint Tech board
became part of a top class university entrepreneur community
multiple companies (GitHub. Unacademy) that sponsored our events
Being a better planner - Every TechSoc event had to be granularly figured out - right from the why. to the domain. to the logistics (approvals. finances. food). marketing plans. grading patterns. feedback loop and process documentation. And prior to that - figuring out which initiatives to run for which target audience and how that tied into the TechSoc vision to provide something to students that they were missing out on.

TechSoc taught me about this more than anything. You have to be a better planner than you ever were when you‚Äôre handling over 5 Lakhs of budget and getting around 30-40 things right in stressful weeks.

Becoming a stronger person - A leader is looked up to be a responsible and strong person. But no one is born that way. You learn by getting hit with a brick in the face. I learnt to be resilient. have more patience. lose the fear of crowd handling. stand my ground in hard negotations. take in a lot of negative feedback and deal with some failures. There were a lot of times when I felt like running away from the problem but the beauty of this PoR is that it won‚Äôt let you. Even when you‚Äôre tired. or tied by administration or resource constrained and super close to giving up. It has definitely increased my self-confidence to stand up to any problem in the world with a - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre TechSoc. we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù attitude.

Being part of something bigger - I had a chance to stand for a strong tech culture at my college - even though it sometimes meant being unhealthily altruistic. Looking back. I‚Äôll have not regretted that I spent my last year complaining about not having a strong tech scene at univer. I‚Äôll carry with me the legacy of having led highly passionate believers who wanted to push the limits of what technology can be.

The De-merits

passing out after 40hrs on non stop competition work and logistics
Constantly stressed - In the early days. especially with the offline shift and even during the competitions. I felt responsible for too many things. It‚Äôs an unprecedented level of stress - that no one should rationally take. Passion might be good reason to do it. but not otherwise. You‚Äôre worried for an event. a team member‚Äôs growth. someone resigning. some plan getting delayed and simultaneously 0 participation in another event on the next day. Since the team is small. unlike other bodies. you‚Äôre involved personally in most things and while the growth is good - the cost it comes at. is also high
Personal sacrifices - Barely any time on most weekends. I remember just bouncing across meetings post 8pm on a lot of weekdays and then standing by the team. I‚Äôve missed a lot of social life. sometimes even personal goals (heck. I didn‚Äôt work on my startup during national competitions) and relaxing. as I struggled to move the needles of 3 different verticals whilst the cores were still warming up. The role does take a lot out of you and it‚Äôs not a good thing always.
A lot of ground-work - My leadership style has always been more hands-on. Might be a good or bad thing. I don‚Äôt know the balance. There are days when people won‚Äôt work upto your standards and you‚Äôll have to step in and help even though you really are just mad and might want to panic and yell at them to get it done. Compassion taught me to share the load - right from being a TShirt distributor to a sweeper to poster designer to food delivery agent.
A crazy story
I'll tell a story of how I learnt persistence. In 2023. I was leading a 90 member contingent from our university to participate in Inter IIT Tech Meet (a national level competition for solving technical challenges). I was managing 15 projects over 2 months and was also in charge of the logistics. travel and accommodation in Kanpur. I booked the train tickets for my contingent through our institute and they assured us of tickets to Kanpur. However. in on the day of travel. amidst 100+ things I juggled all the way upto the train station. I realized that our tickets from Chennai to Kanpur were waitlisted. The train was full and keeping in mind the safety of my team. I told them to get off and said we'd find another way. And so. this story begins with a huge group ¬†of people. staring down at me at 12am on a railway station. with hopes that I'd get them to our competition - 2000 miles away - in the next 36 hours.

I arranged for a bus back to the campus and stayed up till 3. trying to figure out how I'd get my team to Kanpur safely. with the limited budget I had. For context. our institute had a no-flight refund policy for competitions. We brainstormed multiple routes via permutations of bus and train but we'd reach late and fatigued. At 3:15am. Shreepoorna found a reasonable flight ticket deal from Chennai to Delhi. At 3:30am. I poured in all my personal savings of about INR 85000 (with a INR 10000 loan) and booked the tickets to Kanpur. Here's the celebration video of that too.


the moment the tickets for kanpur were booked at 3:30am (gut feeling- all these people are going to make great founders 1 day)
Next. I spent 2 hours breaking it to the 2 people. whose tickets couldn't be booked due to limited funds. At 4am. I was standing at Cauvery Hostel. getting rattled by a junior on how I'd failed my entire purpose as a leader. Returning to my room in a mess. I wrote a long email to the Dean. explaining the situtation before I passed out.

After a 1 hr nap. I woke up in cold sweats. informing our Dean with a long email - the entire situation. 9am. I showed up to their office. shaking. But the admin rallied with us and with their support. got the tickets for the remaining team as well.

After 2 hours we flew to Delhi. In-flight. I worked with the people solving the "entrepreneurship challenge" and got their submission right. Abhishek Gupta (on campus) was making the pitch deck all the way to 12 when we submitted it. before we finally got kicked out of the cafe we made our makeshift office. with just a single coffee order. Next. at Delhi. we haggled and arranged bus transport to Kanpur for all with a 40% discount. Turns out. back then. online bookings weren't considered valid and you had to physically haggle and get people in the bus.

Fun fact. we got screwed over by the bus guys who dropped us about 25km away and once again. stranded on a highway at 7am. our team is bargaining with auto drivers to get us there.

Finally. after the entire long journey. we reached Kanpur campus 10 hours before time. 24 hours after that. with a parched throat. I pitched and won the silver medal for my college at the entrepreneurship challenge. Oh and the savings I put in? I got them reimbursed a month later by tweaking around my cloud provider SaaS costs and showing AWS credits as expenditure (technically. I did lose the money).

This is my favourite story that I like to share as I can neither put it in my resume nor will it be a conventional interview question - but it is so fundamental to my way of working - Persistence. I'd rather sweat in a garage than recline in a cabin. Cause where other's see unconvention. I see genius. "Ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. are the ones who really do"

Here's another story blog I wrote about an initiative TechSoc created and ran - to motivate students to believe and build projects - link

Okay so this post is not actually about college ragging but majorly about Retrieval Generated Augmentation (RAG). a cool machine learning and indexing application I came across while building CloudPilot - "the copilot for cloud engineers"

What is CloudPilot? ‚úàÔ∏è
CloudPilot was a project we built with the vision of going from idea to cloud within 10 minutes.

The goal of the project was to enable any thinker to start with a business problem. quickly to research and come up with a wholesome engineering document that had the solution approach. its architecture and performance analysis done well in under 10 minutes.

This product was built at a hackathon in under 24 hours. Let me know if there are any improvements you want me to look at.

And with that. let's dive in. into the product flow



What does a cloud engineer do?
First. let's understand how cloud architects function and come up with infrastructure solutions for a given business problem. See. as a typical cloud architect - the flow is as follows

Step 0: - It starts with a problem statement such as a architecture for payment gateway or a data migration pipeline or a high availability server fleet setup.
Step 1: Ask the right questions - Several times. we go back and forth with the problem statement to understand what are the exact business requirements and what are important aspects that we need to optimize for.
Step 2: Research - With the given requirements. the standard approach is to go online. read up some blogs by cloud providers. read case studies and open source articles to get context and understand our problem statement. Here. typically a lot of time is just spent in finding the right article. Most software problems have precedents that have solved the requirement wholly or in parts. Hence. finding the right documentation for similar requirements is of paramount importance.
Step 3: Technical Requirements - Once we have asked the right questions. we prepare a brief technical document. highlighting the most important performance expectations from the software and then start researching what kind of cloud offerings do we require. We also quantify that to what extent do we want to look at satisfying a particular goal. eg: 500 TB of storage. 80ms latency in communication. 7 0s of availability. 8GB GPUs for ML training.
Step 4: List the building blocks - Here. we simply map each techinal requirement to an existing cloud service we can use and do a comparative analysis. If it's ML. it's gotta be Google Cloud. for availability and cost. it's gotta be AWS - that kinda thing. So we start listing cloud offerings such as EC2 (AWS). Maps API (Google Cloud) or Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Azure). We think of using these offerings as builing blocks for the entire architecture and justify why the offering is important
Step 5: Join the blocks - Here. we join together the building blocks as services that communicate with 1 another and draw a systems diagram that helps to understand how the overall system works. Which part does what function and how it's role fits into the overall requirement.
Step 6: Iterate - Once an end-to-end flow is ready. we do overall Product. Engineering and Cost Analysis and then we iterate upon the design to optimize for certain aspects - make it faster. make it cheaper. increase the storage. increase the redundancy - that kind of thing. And based on that. we improve the choice of building blocks and integrating them together in 1 system
Step 7: Templatize - Once a cloud architecture is ready. we start looking at using Cloud templates such as CloudFormation by AWS. Terraform by Hashicorp to easily just deploy the entire architecture and have a skeleton of it functional to understand performance on a practical level.
Thus. this is the overall flow of the entirety of coming up with a cloud architecture. Beautiful and methodical.

So if we were to copilotize this process we would need an AI agent who could read through all cloud architecture related blogs. docs. case-studies like an engineer and intuitively go through steps 1 to 8 and help arrive upon a solution.

And that's why we used something called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique where we retrieved the right list of documents from the internet and asked our Large Language Model to generate an answer from text that it studied from these docs.

Before we segway into what we did. let's study in short - what is this "Retrieval Augmented Generation" anyways?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)


Imagine you're a chef and you're trying to create a new dish. First. you go to your pantry (which has a vast array of ingredients). This is akin to the retrieval part. You take a look at different recipes you have used in the past or a recipe book for ideas. You fetch or 'retrieve' ingredients and inspiration based on these recipes.

Next. you start to combine these ingredients together. perhaps in a way you've never done before. You might modify some of the recipes to match your taste or to make the dish unique. This is similar to the 'generation' part of the process.

Now. let's say you have some guests coming over and you know their preferences. To accommodate them. you decide to modify your new dish even further or add some garnish to make it look more appealing. This is comparable to the 'augmentation' part. where you make some tweaks to make the final result better suited for its purpose.

Bringing it back to the context of AI and natural language processing. Retrieval-Generated Augmentation is a method where you:

'Retrieve' relevant data or content from a large dataset (like a chef searching through the pantry or recipe books).
'Generate' new data or content based on this retrieved data (like a chef creating a new dish using the fetched ingredients). and then
'Augment' this generated content. usually by making some modifications to better suit the task at hand (like a chef adjusting the dish to suit the guests' taste).
This method is very useful for tasks that involve generating text or other types of data. especially when you want to produce content that is tailored for a specific task. purpose. or audience.

It's also a way to improve the performance of machine learning models. by providing them with a richer. more varied dataset to learn from. The richer and more varied the 'ingredients' (i.e.. the data). the better the 'dish' (i.e.. the model's output) can potentially be.



How we built the damn thing
Part 1: "Retrieve"
For this we would leverage the open-source documents. blogs. systems diagrams and articles by major Cloud Providers such as AWS. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

We created a custom index of just these documents. Using Amazon Kendra. we indexed over 192000 such information webpages using its web-connector. Here. the major difficulty we faced was understanding which XML sitemaps did we have to index and how. Some documents were in Japanese and some were just plain irrelevant marketing content. So intelligent document structure filtering was required at this level to index the right documents for our search.

Thus. this helped us to get the best documents to pull in for a given query. For example the queries below.




Using Kendra for getting top documents for a given search query
Part 2: "Generate"
Alright so you've got the top 10 documents you're supposed to refer to. But how can we improve the experience of gleaning valuable insights for your given business problem? That's where we use the superpower of an LLM. It's like asking it to read all documents and answer over it

So. once we "retrieve" the documents from Amaz√∏n Kendra. we ask the LLM to take the top 5 most relevant documents. pass all the text in them as tokens to the LLM (number of tokens varies depending on the LLM. we used GPT-4 by OpenAI that takes in upto 8000 tokens). The LLM parses the text and via few-shot learning over the context of business problem and the documents from Kendra. "generates" a response for the end user.

This is the simple task. Get the relevant docs and then generate a textual response from the same. Let's improve the experience now.



Part 3: The end-to-end architecture
Stringing together this in an entire experience involved developing the following flow.

Get the input prompt for the business requirement from the user and generate a set of relevant questions about the business to ask the user. For this we used an LLM


We recorded the question answers and the business requirement. did some text summarization and trimming (using nltk to remove whitespaces. punctuations etc.) and then we pass it all as a cumulative context for searching best documents in Amazon Kendra

Next. we get the best docuements from Amazon Kendra as text. combine that with business prompt and QnA and pass it to our LLM for giving a textual response

Once we get the response. we return that. along with hyperlinks to the documents that Kendra returned so the user can get our summarized.structured answer as well as refer the source documents for more information at their own leisure

To help the cloud engineer with more specific information. we added a feature to generate the following from the textual answer
6. Systems diagram for the architecture proposed to understand how to link together the building blocks
7. IaaC code template - Basically a CloudFormation code template to quickly just spin up the architecture and study its performance and behavior in cloud
8. Cost estimation - based on information that the LLM has been trained on. using AWS pricing docs as data source

Lastly. we provided a chat interface for the user to keep passing more requirements (such as "make it cheaper?". "make the system faster?") to the service. Now. we pass a combination of these 4 things to the LLM to get an improved answer = original business prompt + QnA + generated answer + additional user request



What can we improve upon?
Here's the current complete system that was built:



Okay so this project was awesomely exciting but the main complaint I have from it is that it is too slow. It still takes 2 minutes to generate answers and diagrams. A way to improve that would be some compute on frontend or some level of caching

Also. the answers are still generic and unless the prompt is well-engineered. we wouldn't discover novel architectures and solutions. So. that's something we need to fine-tune for. Maybe some sort of a framework for the user to engineer their prompt even better. Asking better technical requirement questions for a given business prompt could be a good starting point.

Lastly. it's expensive. Kendra is expensive and so is using OpenAI. So the approach for solving this is - open-source it! A search index with Elasticsearch combined with a custom LLM such as the Llama. Lima and Flan-T5 models can help cut down on costs

Oooh. a cool feature could have also using voice to speech and language translation (with using localized cloud services docs) to provide multilingual support to our beloved copilot

In closing....
We're having a copilot for pretty much everything these days ever since the Generative AI hype cycle started so I just thought of creating something that could help engineers to better adopt the Cloud Services by any cloud and help leverage them in the best possible way

I'd rather sweat in a garage then recline in a cabin
The story for this starts with wanting to figure out how a student can get from point A in skillset to point B in skillset (their desired ambition) - given an educational ecosystem that provides certain opportunities. And we did realize it. atleast for 3000+ students in my undergraduate college.

I ran Coursepanel for a year and we built several cool things in this journey. I'll keep this blog fairly technical but also throw in certain snippets about entrepreneurship and lessons learnt along the way. Most of this blog is going to be about the technical implementation of this project. I have mentioned my learnings as an entrepreneur in the end.

To read the story of the early days and launch. checkout - here


Technical Deep-dive
Understanding Natural Language Processing and Vector Embeddings
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science. artificial intelligence. and linguistics. It involves programming computers to effectively process large amounts of natural language data. As part of NLP. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. developed by OpenAI. are designed to generate human-like text based on the inputs they receive. They are trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate contextually relevant text.

However. they do not know specific documents or sources they were trained on and don't have the capability to access or retrieve specific documents or databases during the generation process. Their strength lies in understanding and generating text that closely resembles human-like responses. thus forming a key part of systems like CourseGPT.

Vector embeddings are another crucial component of such systems. In the realm of machine learning. embeddings are a way to convert categorical variables into continuous vectors so as to feed them into a model. They can be used to capture the semantics of words in a language. relationships between items. and even user behavior in an application.


Basic demo of how words are converted into vector embeddings (source)

These embeddings. when stored in a vector database. form the basis of effective search and recommendation systems.

Building a vector database using a knowledge graph
For the purpose of this project. based on the previous training data. we turned our knowledge graph (aka ‚Äúskillmap‚Äù) into a vector database for storing entries and answering queries related to academic data. This was done in 4 steps:

Creating a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j: The first step involved modeling our data as a graph and storing it in Neo4j. Our nodes represent entities such as NPTEL courses. books. departments. etc.. and relationships represented the connections between these entities
Generating Vector Embeddings: The next step involved generating vector embeddings from our graph. These embeddings are a form of representation that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of your data in the form of vectors in a high-dimensional space. There are several techniques to generate graph embeddings. like Node2Vec. GraphSAGE. etc. This project used the Node2Vec library in Python to achieve the same. We ran Node2Vec algorithms on our Neo4j graph to generate node and relationship embeddings.
Store Vector Embeddings: The generated embeddings then needed to be stored for future use. Typically. we‚Äôd want a database that is optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. You could use a vector database like Pinecone. Faiss. or even Elasticsearch with a vector plugin for this purpose.
Querying the Vector Database: The final part involved using these vector embeddings to make our application smarter. For example. we could now perform operations like semantic search. recommendations. or similarity checks by comparing vectors. This involved querying our vector database for the nearest vectors to a given input vector. which gave us the most semantically similar entities to our query.
Scoping NPTEL data into the Vector Database and building a chatbot
To create a system like CourseGPT. we first need to load the relevant data into the vector database. Let's assume we have course data from NPTEL in a CSV format. This data can be processed and converted into vector embeddings using various techniques like Word2Vec. GloVe. or even using transformers-based models. These vector representations can then be loaded into the vector database. which allows us to perform efficient similarity search operations.

The vector database enables us to compare the query vector (which can be a representation of a user's query or a specific course interest) with all vectors in our database. and retrieves the most similar entries. These entries represent courses that are most relevant to the user's query.

Once the entries are returned. we need to translate these course vectors back into a human-readable form. This is where LLMs like GPT-3 come into play. These models can generate contextually relevant. human-like text based on the returned entries. The generated text can be as simple as a course name and description. or as complex as a detailed career path recommendation.

In this way. the synergy of NLP. LLMs. and vector databases leads to the development of an effective system like CourseGPT. Such a system can revolutionize the way we approach professional upskilling and corporate training by providing personalized. contextual. and interactive learning experiences.

The journey in a nutshell
The development and evolution of CourseGPT. spread over a 12-month period. could've been a significant step forward in the application of advanced technologies such as AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP). and Knowledge Graphs to the critical area of professional upskilling and corporate training.

The journey began with understanding the problem domain. setting the objectives and scope. and constructing the methodology flowchart. The decision to pick a test sandbox environment of similar nature proved instrumental in aligning the development of CourseGPT closely with the real-world challenges encountered in professional learning and development.

Deep dives into models of corporate training. specifically the Kirkpatrick Model. provided insights into the metrics for successful training outcomes. Skill mapping using a knowledge graph emerged as a novel and efficient approach to resolving course recommendations and facilitating an effective learning journey for the students.

Working with the NPTEL team and building a skill map for IIT Madras underscored the potential of this tool in academic environments as well. Implementing Natural Entity Recognition and NLP allowed us to extract valuable course tags and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Moreover. the research conducted at HyperVerge Academy (HVA) enabled a deeper understanding of the professional upskilling space. Facing and overcoming various challenges along the way. we succeeded in developing a competency engine and data model that significantly enriched the capabilities of CourseGPT.

Finally. CourseGPT emerged as an intelligent product. leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to recommend courses based on career goals. plan academic journeys. solve student doubts. and inclusively cater to diverse learners. The journey. although filled with complexities and challenges. offered valuable insights into the future of AI-enabled learning and set a foundation for ongoing research and development.

Here's the various launch videos of products that I built. just as a nostalgic flash from the past.





Why I failed to run it as a company.
With Coursepanel. we made around 35000 INR in revenue with 3000+ free users and then got stuck in a loop of developing without continuous customer interaction. I shut down Coursepanel in May 2023. I was embarassed. mentally disturbed and self-doubting when I did it. It was hard and it was like I had given up on a dream ¬†and failed myself. But picking up and moving on is the way forward. Here are a few things I learnt from this experience - these aren't novel learnings - these are the same fuckups most startup folks advise against but I did it anyway and learnt it again - at a heavy price:

Don't do it alone. It's not that I'm doubting individual capability - it's just that context switching has a very difficult toll when you ¬†want strong velocity in both business and innovaiton. Also there's the emotional burden of doing it alone. Worst case. atleast have a friend to talk to and help sort out a lot of operations and communications
It's best to build a shitty product with continuous customer interaction but no point of siloed building. no matter what you feel about current systems. Even asking and then building then again asking then building - i.e. an intermittent month-to-month setup might not help. Atleast talk to users each week.
Make money from the start. It's the only way to stay afloat.
Don't get to emotionally attached to your innovation or amazed by exciting new things you can do. Focus on the minimum that gets you paid. get it right and then expand with bolder experiments.
It's boring and requires discipline and routine to continuously outperform other teams. You have to consistently just keep pushing. Motivation is 2/3rds of this game.

So yeah. I guess that's about it. I was very passionate. worked very hard and was heartbroken - but I guess I'm carrying forward a lot - something that classroom would have never taught me. Let's see. I'm about to do something again in the Generative AI space. This time - business first though - get the "what are people gonna pay for" right and then expand from that base thought into technical innovation and exquisite design.

Problems define markets
Having a more accurate understanding of the market in which your product is really competing
A market is not tied to any specific solutions that meet those needs. That is why you see ‚Äúmarket disruptions‚Äù: when a new type of product (solution space) better meets the market needs (problem space)
The ‚Äúwhat‚Äù describes the benefits that the product should give the customer‚Äîwhat the product will accomplish for the user or allow the user to accomplish.
The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the way in which the product delivers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to the customer. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is problem space and ‚Äúhow‚Äù is solution space.
üí°
What = problem space
How = solution space
Lean product teams articulate the hypotheses they have made and solicit customer feedback on early design ideas to test those hypotheses.

Should you listen to customers?
It‚Äôs true that customers aren‚Äôt going to lead you to the Promised Land of a break-through innovative product. but customer feedback is like a flashlight in the night: it keeps you from falling off a cliff as you try to find your way there.

Using the solution space to discover the problem space
Hard for customers to talk about abstract benefits and the relative importance of each‚Äîand when they do. it‚Äôs often fraught with inaccuracies
This can be solved by techniques like "contextual inquiry" or "customer discovery"
The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. If you show them a new product or design. they can tell you what they like and don‚Äôt like. They can compare it to other solutions and identify pros and cons.
The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created
Divergent and convergent thinking
You should be practicing divergent thinking. which means trying to generate as many ideas as possible without any judgment or evalua-tion. There will be plenty of time later for convergent thinking. where you evaluate the ideas and decide which ones you think are the most promising.

you want to capture all the ideas that your team generated. then organize them by the benefit that they deliver.
Then. for each benefit. you want to review and prioritize the list of feature ideas.
You can score each idea on expected customer value to determine a first-pass priority.
The goal is to identify the top three to five features for each benefit.
There is not much value in looking beyond those top features right now because things will change‚Äîa lot‚Äîafter you show your prototype to customers.
A user story is a brief description of the benefit that the particular functionality should provide. including whom the benefit is for (the target customer). and why the customer wants the benefit.

üí°
As a [type of user]. I want to [do something]. so that I can [desired benefit].
¬†eg : As a professional photographer.I want to easily upload pictures from my camera to my website.so that I can quickly show my clients their pictures. ¬†

üí°
INVEST framework
I - independent of other stories
N - not explicit and must be flexible. open for discussion
V - valuable to customer
E - reasonlaby estimate scope
S - small
T - testable
¬†

Small tickets and smaller ticket batch sizes are better
Break tickets into atomic chunks. Trim extra stuff
The batch size is the number of products worked on together at the same time in parallel. Faster velocity of small batches -> faster feedback -> reduce risk and waste
The longer you work on a product with-out getting customer feedback. the more you risk a major disconnect that subsequently requires significant rework.
Scoping with story points
Story points - type of currency for estimating relative ticket size
Have a max threshold for story points
Good operating principle ¬†- break down stories with high points into smaller stories
Return on investment to prioritize
When you are building a product or feature. the investment is usually the time that your development resources spend working on it. which you generally measure in units such as developer-weeks (one developer working for one week).
It‚Äôs true that you could probably calculate an equivalent dollar amount. but people use units like developer-weeks because they are simpler and clearer
Visualizing ROI

Good product teams strive to come up with ideas like idea G in Figure 6.1‚Äîthe ones that create high customer value for low effort.
Great product teams are able to take ideas like that. break them down into chunks. trim off less valuable pieces. and identify creative ways to deliver the customer value with less effort than initially scoped‚Äîindicated in the figure by moving idea G to the left.
The accuracy of the estimates should be proportional to the fidelity of the product definition
The main point of these calculations is less about figuring out actual ROI values and more about how they compare to each other
¬†

Approximating ROI and Deciding on MVP candidate

Just comparing feature importance wrt one another. Once that‚Äôs done. arrange all features in this format as per benefit categories


Intentionally give them generic names so that you can more easily envision replacing them with what would be relevant for your product. ‚ÄúM1A‚Äù means feature chunk A for must-have 1. ‚ÄúP2B‚Äù means feature chunk B for perfor-mance benefit 2. and ‚ÄúD2C‚Äù means feature chunk C for delighter benefit 21.
Decide on the MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONALITY that will resonate with TG users
Look down the leftmost column of feature chunks and determine which ones you think need to be in your MVP candidate. While doing so. you should refer to your product value proposition
After this. focus on the main performance benefit you‚Äôre planning to use to beat the competition
Delighters are part of your differentiation. too. You should include your top delighter in your MVP candidate.
So if you‚Äôve made tentative plans beyond your MVP. you must be prepared to throw them out the window and come up with new plans based on what you learn from customers.

Moving on to MVP and early Prototyping
Use the broad term MVP ‚Äúprototype‚Äù to capture the wide range of items you can test with cus-tomers to gain learning. While the first ‚Äúprototype‚Äù you test could be your live MVP. you can gain faster learning with fewer resources by testing your hypotheses before you build your MVP.

What is/isn't an MVP?

There has been spirited debate over what qualifies as an MVP. Some people argue vehemently that a landing page is a valid MVP. Others say it isn‚Äôt. insisting that an MVP must be a real. working product or at least an interactive prototype.
The way I resolve this dichotomy is to realize that these are all methods to test the hypotheses behind your MVP. By using the term ‚ÄúMVP tests‚Äù instead of MVP. the debate goes away
Product vs Marketing MVP Tests

Marketing test - You‚Äôre simply describing the functionality to prospective customers to see how compelling they find your description
MVP Tests - validate your product will involve showing prospective customers functionality to solicit their feedback on it. You may be showing them a live beta product or just low fidelity wireframes to assess product-market fit
Marketing tests can provide valuable learning. but they‚Äôre not an actual product that creates customer value. At some point. you need to test a prototype of your MVP candidate
Quantitative vs Qualitative MVP Tests

Qualitative - you are talking with customers directly. usually in small numbers that don‚Äôt yield statistical significance eg: If. for example. you conducted one-on-one feedback sessions with 12 prospective customers to solicit their feedback on a mockup of your landing page. then that would be qualitative research

Quantitative - conducting the test at scale with alarge number of customers. ¬†You don‚Äôt care as much about any indi-vidual result and are instead interested in the aggregate results.

eg: If you launched two versions of your landing page and directed thousands of customers to each one to see which one had the higher conversion rate. then that would be a quantitative test.

Quant = what. how; Qual = why

Quantitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many‚Äù: what actions customers took and how many customers took an action (e.g.. clicked on the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button). But quantitative tests will not tell you why they chose to do so or why the other customers chose not to do so. In contrast. qualitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: the reasons behind different customers‚Äô decisions to take an action or not.

If you don't know where you're going. you might not get there
Objective Key-Result (OKR) is a framework of approaching a goal/project that ensures that you and your team make 1000s of decisions and steps. while being aligned on a common vision.

This blog will largely explore the key learnings I've gathered from this awesome book on the topic called "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. If you're curious. this person learnt the OKR framework from top management at Intel and replicated successfully. the same principles - at Google and grew the young startup at breakneck speed with people and products - whilst retaining the core vision of making information easily accessible to all.

The very 1st slide John showed to team Google said OKRS: "A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization"

I'll litter this blog with excerpts and stories that the book explored and I found most helpful.

OKR short intro
Objective is the WHAT is to bo achieved. These are significant. concrete. action oriented and ideally inspirational.

Key Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound. aggressive yet reliastic. Most of all they're measurable and reliable.

Where an objective can be long-lived. rolled over for a year or longer. key results evolve as the work progresses. Once the KRs are completed -> the objective is achieved

Thus. OKRs channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse ops. lending purpose and unity to the entire org. This is supremely important at startups or young companies where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction

The maker of OKR
Andy Grove. an Intel exec is credited for having created the management system of OKRs when Intel had taken up the responsibility of Operation Crush - a race to win in the 16-bit microprocessor market with their 8086 product in a time where cheaper and less performant products were eating market share.

It was the glorious story of how Intel dumped the business of memory-chip and went all-in on microprocessors and completely "crushed" every other contemporary compute company.

Here. are the 1st tenets of this system. by Dr. Grove himself:

Less is more
Set goals from the bottom up
No dictating
Stay flexible
Dare to fail
Here's a free OKR template for your use - link

Great companies take the surplus cash flows created by their sustainable competitive advantages and then either return those to shareholders or reinvest those in their core franchise or - and this is the litmus test of greatness - reinvest those successfully in new activities or markets
"Unusual Billionaires". by Saurabh Mukherjea. is an unusually riveting & practical thesis. It is a collection of stories of brilliant companies that made their dent in the world by continuously innovating. providing great service. and building powerful teams & stable assets. It teaches us the unconventional yet core fundamental process of sustainably building great companies amidst this era of venture-backed rocketship dreams.

In this blog I'll be listing snippets from the book. that teach us all. the values of how great companies our built and share my thoughts on the same. ¬†In this market of the recession of fly-high crashes of crypto exchanges. the gloom of overpowering AI agents & plummeting stock prices. I think we can all take a page out of these learnings & realize how lasting services are created.

Asian paints
Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness. it turns out. is largely a matter of conscious choice. ~ Jim Collins (Good to great)
An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an empire ~ Yuval Nova Harari
A great company attracts the best talent. commands respect in the business community and. more often than not. trades at a premium in the stock market
Greatness is meant to be an enduring quality. Stock prices are an effect and not a cause of a company‚Äôs greatness
Metrics in a great company
Revenue growth of 10% and ROCE of 15% every year for non-financial services companies
Loan book growth of 15% and ROE of 15% every year for financial services companies
‚ÄúWe have consciously stuck to a sector which is growing and offers decent potential and have always strived for excellence across all functional areas. But it is not because somebody is observing us and is going to applaud us. We have just stuck to our knitting sensibly as the sector has evolved over decades - Jalaj Dani (promoter)
By obsessively using tech and talent to improve on internal processes and efficiencies. these companies put considerable distance between themselves and the competitions. In particular. this focus on efficiency and cost reduction helps the champion companies sustain high levels of profitability in a way that most of their rivals simply can‚Äôt match
Create and nurture an environment in which a multitude of talented minds work in harmony so that mutual competence is reinforcing rather than debilitating
IBAS framework - Innovation. Brands & rep. architecture. strategic assets
Innovation - shopkeeper would get 3.5% extra discount. if. without fail. he made payments on time throughout the year. adoption of computers & GPS
Brands & rep - Asian Paints changed their messaging to maintain an emotional connection with their target audience. Thus came the brand ambassador of a mischievous kid with a can of paint (name - ‚ÄúGattu‚Äù)
Architecture - Creating a truly independent board of directors to help shape evolution of the firm. Rapid career progression for those who perform with job rotation at reg. intervals.
Empowerment allows creativity. It‚Äôs about the feeling of being a family - Jalaj Dani
Strategic assets - sources of competitive advantages - intellectual property. licences. regulatory permissions. access to natural resources and natural monopolies
On the trust Asian paints built - ‚Äú50% of dealers won‚Äôt check their accounts. despite having access to a web portal which gives them real time updates on their accounts‚Äù
Berger
The most difficult thing to change at a company is to change its people

Don‚Äôt recruit someone who is not able to do a job. just to fill a vacancy. Secondly. even if we don‚Äôt have a job. but you come across the right person. you must recruit him

In FY13. talent and skill are increasingly becoming scarce and it requires considerable effort to identify. engage and retain such talents. The report also added that salary alone is not the criteria for satisfaction of deserving employees and that the firm needs to offer a participative work environment and an open culture

Marico
I strongly believe that culture can be a source of competitive advantage in an org and it is impossible to copy. The org‚Äôs culture is a major driving force in the execution of strategy. Correct culture helps in proper execution of strategy by helping everyone align on the same page (Mariwala)
A promoter supporting and listening to the board. although being a 60 percent shareholder. makes indep directors feel proud because we think that we are able to contribute to Marico. These things don‚Äôt reflect directly on the balance sheet. P&L or share price. but these are inputs which go into creation of long-term shareholder wealth
Page
Many companies justify risking balance sheet & profits for fueling growth. However. Page has maintained steadfast financial discipline whilst expanding its operations and at the same time. its share prices have also kept up an upward trend
‚ÄòOur managers understand that it‚Äôs not about having power but about how you empower your subordinates & bring about the best results from your team members. Hence each member behaves like a leader and that gives us a winning culture - Sunder Genomal
‚ÄòFrom day one. Mr Genomal has pushed us into adopting a process-oriented approach. Almost everything we do at Page is part of an Excel sheet.
‚ÄòWe want to keep our distributors‚Äô balance sheets healthy because our business is dependent on their finances. If they have the wrong inventory stuck with them. it neither helps us nor them
Even the core projects will not be taken up unless they promise an ROCE of atleast 20%
Axis bank
Hemant Kaul on Supriya Gupta - My offer letter from Axis Bank had no details about compensation. But the temptation to start a new bank with Gupta overshadowed all my inhibitions - On joining Axis
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre in a commodity business. the only way to thrive is to be a low-cost producer. And when you‚Äôre selling money. you‚Äôre in a commodity business - Duff McDonald
Shikha Sharma - I advise other companies‚Äô CEOs not to fall into the trap where you go - Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth? Where‚Äôs the growth - They feel a tremendous pressure to grow. Well. sometimes you can‚Äôt grow. Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to grow. In certain businesses. growth means you either take on bad clients. excess risk or too much leverage - Jamie Dimon (CEO of JPMC)
The shift from people to processes was critical as the bank was moving away from reliance on corporate banking to retail banking (which needs very high use of data & analytics based decision making to grow the business whilst maintaining commercial viability
This operating structure makes the CEO of a pvt bank both less powerful than a promoter of a non-bank company but more influential than the CEO of a non-bank company (pg 209)
Employee policies are very consistent at Axis Bank and there is little ambiguity and subjectivity in the pay hikes and bonuses. All supervisors have to clearly explain the ratings they assign to their subordinates - something that decides pay rise. promotion & bonus. You won‚Äôt find this in other pvt sector banks. where a lot of randomness prevails in salary hikes. bonuses & promotions where lower rated employees have got higher bonuses
HDFC bank
Building a visionary company requires 1% vision & 99% alignment - Jim Collins
An org‚Äôs ability to learn & translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive advantage - Jack Welch
HDFC Bank‚Äôs strength rests not so much on the uniqueness of tech it uses but in the way that tech is lined up in a clever process flow i.e. not envisaged by other banks.
Strong focus on systems & procedures meant that the people who succeeded them did not find it difficult to take over responsibilities quickly
Astral
We came to a point where our day to day business was to just survive. Sandeep Engineer
We had to build scale. We made the market for CPVC in India and if we didn‚Äôt increase capacities aggressively. someone else would have borne the fruit of our hard work. Sandeep Engineer
Instead of copying foreign technologies. Engineer forged technical partnerships with global majors to launch innovative products in India
His biggest strength is simplicity and humility. There has been no change in his personality even after the manifold growth of Astral. He still drinks tea from a roadside stall along with his dealers
Engineer would tell plumbers not to see themselves as plumbers. but as doctors who treat the big problem of leaking pipes in homes
Greatness is not Everyone‚Äôs Cup of Tea
Strategy is about making smart choices and execution is about relentless implementation ~ Phil Rosenzweig
The business of business is a lot of little decisions every day mixed up with a few big decisions ~ Tom Murphy
Those who achieve long-lasting success in India are often those who are unflashy . introverted. determined. and intelligently tenacious
Rahul Dravid‚Äôs of the business world - rare. determined and constantly seeking to improve the edge or the advantage they enjoy vis-a-vis their competitors
What makes a great company:
Theme A - Focus on the long term (more than ten years) without being distracted by short-term gambles
Theme B - Constantly deepen the moat around the core franchise using the IBAS framework
Theme C - Sensibly allocate capital whilst studiously avoiding betting the balance sheet on expensive and unrelated forays
Ability to steadfastly focus on doing the same thing for decades on end whilst gradually strengthening their franchise. generating surplus cash from that endeavour and then giving much of that back to shareholders whilst reinvesting the rest judiciously
Ram Charan - Leaders who say ‚ÄúI have got ten priorities‚Äù don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about
Jim Collins(Great by Choice. 2011) - 20 Mile March requires hitting specified performance markers with great consistency over a long period of time. It requires 2 distinct types of discomfort. delivering high performance in difficult times and holding back in good times
Good management teams work on proving a concept before investing a lot of capital. They are not likely to put a lot of money in all at once. hoping for a big payoff - Michael Shearn
Firstly. diversifications if any. are consciously restrained. instead of breaking or stretching the balance sheet. Secondly. surplus cash. when available. is returned to shareholders when in can‚Äôt be effectively deployed without dragging the ROCE down sharply. Whilst all of this might sound straightforward. these axioms are rarely implemented by Indian promoters who all too often treat their listed companies as their personal fiefdoms and short-change the minority shareholders
A company‚Äôs profitability increases as it moves up the value addition chain
Competitive advantage - if value added is the difference between the cost of a company‚Äôs inputs and that of its output. then competitive advantage allows a company to add more value than its rivals. Furthermore. a sustainable competitive advantage enables a company to continue sustaining this extra value addition over long periods of time
Unless innovation becomes a process which a firm lives day in and day out. the firm will appear impressive initially. and then ultimately disappoint. A product can be quickly outdated. but a successful brand is timeless

What is Back of the envelope?
A Back of the envelope calculation is a simple arithmetic operation frequently carried out on a little piece of paper. like an envelope. Back of the envelope analysis quickly generates a ballpark figure using approximated or rounded figures. An estimate is more accurate than a wild guess but less exact than a formal calculation using precise numbers in a spreadsheet or other program. These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.

In honor of physicist Enrico Fermi. back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.

In this article. we will talk about this methodology's history. applications. and best practices. Furthermore. I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations. Just a disclaimer - the calculations that are about to be added. are made with heavy assumptions - looking at Twitter 2.0 as a new service that we‚Äôll be building & basic components required for the same. The calculations don‚Äôt involve considerations of economies of scale. redundancy. replication and most estimations that involve scaling. We are just understanding a basic implementation of storage for the app. for the scale it is it


Twitter 2.0‚Äôs System Design diagram shared by Elon Musk in November 2022 - Source

Why are back of the envelope calculations needed?
The calculation generally informs us if the design can satisfy the functional requirements. such as the number of supported users. response latency. and resource needs. For instance. when deciding between different architectural designs. the simplest question to ask is whether one server is enough. To get a ballpark figure. we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require. if not one.

Notable Industry Applications
Some of the use cases where back of the envelope calculation has been used:

An important Internet protocol. the Border Gateway Protocol. was sketcBeforein 1989 by engineers on the back of "three ketchup-stained napkins". and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.
UTF-8. the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.
The Bailey bridge is a type of portable. pre-fabricated. truss bridge and was extensively used by British. Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.
The Laffer Curve. which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income. was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.
We've looked at some of the important historical applications of the back of the envelope. now we'll examine the arithmetic process to see how we can utilise it to solve our own issues. This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.

Getting Started with Back of the Envelope
Whenever we try to learn something new. we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly. when beginning system design estimations. we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers. used for estimating the speed of a system. are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency. as a term. helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example. the latency of the best video chat applications. such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.

How can we implement this?
Before approximating the real utilization. we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance. we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.

How can we guess the real usage?

The utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and. if necessary. further divided) and combined.

For instance. we might anticipate 1K active users. each of whom submits 15 requests daily.

15K requests per day. or 15K/86400 requests per second. are involved.

An effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly. Nobody likes to multiply by 86400. To give 0.2 seconds to serve a single request. let's round to 20K/100K. We need to set up at least 4 computers if we know that it takes 0.7 seconds to serve one request. Of course. you don't want to live on the edge. so let's increase the number of machines by a buffer and make it ten.

How to calculate quickly
If someone asked you to calculate: 2456000 x 4598; that would slow things down. wouldn‚Äôt it?

The simpler way to calculate quickly would be instead of spelling down a whole number. use small numbers paired with an abbreviation for magnitude (or. if necessary. exponents). 1K as opposed to 1000.

When given a huge. excessively exact number. such as 7432. immediately translate it to 7K. Anyhow. you are estimating.

This format for numbers makes multiplication and division quick.

KK is M. [K is Kilo; M is Mega]

G/M is K. [G is Giga]

4K7M = 28G.

Round both of them towards a small multiple of a power of 2 or 10 to work with larger numbers.

2714 ~= 3010 = 3000.
6500/250 ~= 6400/256 ~= 100 * 2^6 / 2^8 ~= 100 / 2^2 = 25.
Where to start Back of the envelope?
List the common use-cases of the system and decide which critical resources they require. You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start. but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?

Varied use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance. serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU. whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM. Since you need to purchase machines that are maxed out on both dimensions. hosting all those services on homogeneous machines would waste CPU and RAM.

Such differences indicate those features should be split to different services. hosted on independent sets of machines.

Real-world case study - Storage Costs borne by Twitter

Source

Problem: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements
Please note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers from Twitter.

Assumptions:

300 million monthly active users.
50% of users use Twitter daily.
Users post 2 tweets per day on average.
10% of tweets contain media.
Data is stored for 5 years.
Estimations:

Query per second (QPS) estimate:

Daily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million
Tweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500
Peek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000
Let‚Äôs start solving
There are 2 important queries that need to be addressed for any system:

‚ÄúRequests per second‚Äù at the server level
‚ÄúQueries per second‚Äù at the database level.
Let‚Äôs start with ‚Äúrequests per second‚Äù & what inputs are required to estimate its number

Users: Twitter has 300 million active MAUs. Not every user on Twitter is an active post-maker. 50% use daily - 150 million DAU
Usage per DAU: 10-25% make a tweet. Again. this doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; getting within an order of magnitude should be fine. Say each DAU. on average. makes 2 tweets: so 0.25%*2 = 0.5 tweets per DAU.
Scaling factor: Usage rate for a service has peaks & valleys throughout the day. Eg: The usage rate for your favorite e-commerce store or food delivery app will heavily increase in the case of discounts or sales in a particular festive season. We need to estimate how high the traffic would peak compared to the average. This would reflect the request per second peak where the design could potentially break. Most people tweet in the morning. so the tweet creation traffic is twice the average when US east coast wakes up.
Thus. total tweets in a day = 150 M DAU * (0.5 tweets/DAU) * (2x scaling factor in the morning)
Thus. requests per second = n/(number of seconds in a day) = n/86400 ~ 1500 tweets per second.
Let‚Äôs now look at how much storage is required for storing multimedia files for tweets.

150 million daily tweets. Say 10% of these tweets contain pictures of average size 300kB each & 1% of tweets contain videos of about 50MB each.
Let‚Äôs assume that the files are replicated with 3 copies each & atleast stored for 5 years.
Storage required for pictures = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.1 of tweets have images)* 300kB (image size) * 3copies = 13.5TB.
Storage required for videos per day = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.01 of tweets have videos) * (50MB video size) * 3copies ~ 225TB.
Total storage required for multimedia files per day = 238.5TB
Just the text for a tweet can be stored within 160B (i.e. 1280 bits ~ 160 characters per tweet on average)
Storage required for tweets per day = 150 M * (160B tweet size) * 3copies = 72GB
Let‚Äôs calculate overall storage cost for Twitter
Thus. we learnt that. for running Twitter. in the most basic sense. the following requirements must be met:

Assuming no data compression & our simple 3x replication. in the most basic form - 238.5TB blob storage required for storing all the multimedia of tweets that arrive in a day. 72 GB storage in database is required just for storing the basic tweet content.
Twitter was founded in 2006. However. it launched image sharing in 2011 & video sharing in 2013.
Thus. we can assume. that average storage required per day for videos uploaded by a growing user base can be our current estimate multiplied by a normalization factor of 0.6 (considering 15% of user growth on average. every year. since year of founding).
Thus. we have about (225TB video storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (9 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 443.5PB videos stored.
Similarly for image storage we have (13.5TB photo storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (11 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 32.52PB images stored
To store total multimedia for 11 years worth tweets. in the most fault tolerant & redundant manner. we need - 443.5+32.52 ~ 476.02PB (this figure is close to the actual ballpark around 500PB that Twitter has officially shared here)
Twitter uses AWS for storage of tweets & accompanying multimedia files. Say we use intelligent tiering by S3 to pay for data. that is most recent & popularly accessed. Other data. we can archive. & fetch on demand & pay for.
Estimating the media storage cost
476.02PB can be broken down into. say - 300 PB till 2019 (considering that video & images got introduced late) and 276PB after 2017.
Assuming the worst case pricing of S3 (the standard pricing) - All the multimedia of the last 3 years‚Äô tweets can be stored in S3 regular access & the other. can be stored in S3 archives (so we save cost) Thus. as per S3 pricing values. we end up paying:

For 300PB in archive: 308.073.20 USD monthly

For 276PB in regular tier: 5.935.645.70 USD monthly

Every year. our estimate of Twitter. pays 6.243.718.90 USD monthly. to store our images & videos.

Estimating the database cost for our tweets
Let‚Äôs use AWS relational database DynamoDB to store tweet data in a structured form - such as user info. tweet text. number of likes & retweets.
Twitter needs to store 72GB of tweets in a regular relational database. each day. to keep the lights on.
Again. estimating our normalization factor of 0.6 to aggregate tweet data. across 16 years since Twitter supporting text sharing right from the start. we get - (72 GB tweet data per day) *(365 days)* (16 years since tweeting was launched) * 0.6 = 252.28TB
Thus. using a standard on-demand DynamoDB (unoptimized for cost. but great for scale) - the storage cost comes to 603.355.92 USD monthly. to store our data.
For an actual analysis of all the databases Twitter uses. checkout this reference link
Here‚Äôs the actual AWS calculator cost estimation performed for this purpose.

Thus. this most basic. unoptimized design of that we made. pays 82.164.897.81 USD = 82 million USD every year to AWS. to keep providing its storage services only.

We have not even begun to discuss the computing costs. the data science costs in the cloud. Also. to keep this article a light read. we haven‚Äôt taken into consideration scalability solutions such as caching. multi-AZ databases and several aspects of storage itself.

Thus. you might now understand why Elon Musk is bent on optimizing this system a lot & even implementing the ‚ÄúDeep Cuts‚Äù plan to reduce infrastructure costs by a billion. But trying to fire 50% of the workforce and have the rest leave because the ship is sinking still doesn't make sense. To top it off. if your major problem is infrastructure cost you don't fire engineers. you task engineers to reduce infrastructure costs. Now. we may not agree or disagree with this logic. but atleast we‚Äôve learnt how to ballpark the financial element of the same.

Cheat Sheet for Back of the Envelope
We studied a way of estimating the storage cost borne by Twitter. But what about getting the speed of a video-game streaming platform? Or the requests per second of a payment gateway?

Fear not. here are a few important numbers that we can use to estimate useful metrics of any software system & what corresponding technical requirements it must be able to satisfy.

What do we understand from this

Memory is fast. but the disk is slow.
Avoid disk seeks if possible.
Simple compression algorithms are fast.
Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible.
Data centers are usually in different regions. and it takes time to send data between them.
In a nutshell
A lot of back of the envelope calculations are done with just coefficients and exponents. e.g.. c‚àó10e. Your goal is to get within an order of magnitude right that‚Äôs just e. c matters a lot less.

What did we learn

Back of the envelope calculations allow you to take a look at different variations.
When designing your system. these are the kind of calculations you should do over and over in your head.
Know the back of the envelope numbers for the building blocks of your system. It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers. you have to know how your subsystems perform. You can't make decent back of the envelope calculations if you don't know what's happening.
Monitor and measure every part of your system so you can make these sorts of projections from real data.
I hope you understood how systems are operated in terms of estimating engineering infrastructure requirements. provisions & costing. What‚Äôs the one system that you want me to target next for back of the envelope analysis?

üí°
Tensor is a number/collection of numbers that maintains its meaning under transformations
üí°
More complex. but correct definition - An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules.
Each index of a tensor ranges over the number of dimensions of space. However. the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta).

Tensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices). vectors (that have exactly one index). and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.
Tensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity. fluid mechanics. and general relativity.
Beginner-friendly
Clearing the meaning. usage and confusions about tensors in ML and math
Tensors. a crucial concept in the field of machine learning. deep learning. and data science. often become a stumbling block for many learners. To fully grasp the idea. we'll break it down. explore examples. and demystify various related aspects such as rank. dimension. components. indices. size. and shape.

What are Tensors?
In simple terms. tensors are a generalization of scalars. vectors. and matrices. They can be seen as multidimensional arrays of numbers. with each dimension known as a rank.

A scalar is a single number. a tensor of rank 0.
A vector is an array of numbers. a tensor of rank 1.
A matrix is a 2D array of numbers. a tensor of rank 2.
A 3D array. or a "cube" of numbers. is a tensor of rank 3.
The ranks continue to increase to define higher dimensional spaces.

Breaking Down the Definition of a Tensor
The formal definition of a tensor. "An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules." often overwhelms beginners. So. let's simplify it:

"nth-rank tensor": Rank refers to the number of dimensions or indices the tensor has. For example. a rank 1 tensor is a vector (which has one dimension). a rank 2 tensor is a matrix (which has two dimensions). and so on.
"m-dimensional space": This refers to the size of each dimension. For a matrix (rank 2 tensor). this would be the number of rows and columns.
"m^n components": Components are the individual elements or data points that make up the tensor. For example. in a matrix. each number is a component.
Simplifying with Examples
Consider a 3x3 image with three color channels (Red. Green. Blue). It is represented as a 3D array or a rank 3 tensor. with dimensions of 3 (height) x 3 (width) x 3 (color channels). It would have 3^3 or 27 components (individual color values for pixels).

Delving Deeper: Case of a 4x4 Image
Let's take a more specific example: a 4x4 pixel image with three color channels. Here. the tensor would have a rank of 3 (height. width. and color channels). The dimensions would be 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels). and there would be 4^3 or 64 components.

The indices here refer to the position of each component within the tensor. For example. you might reference the red color value of the pixel in the second row and third column as [2.3.1]. where '2' refers to the row. '3' refers to the column. and '1' refers to the red channel.

The size of this tensor would be calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions together. resulting in 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels) = 48. The shape of this tensor would be (4. 4. 3). describing the number of elements along each dimension.

Difference Between Rank and Dimension
While both terms describe the structure of a tensor. they represent different aspects. The rank is the number of dimensions. while the dimensions refer to the size (or length) of each of those dimensions. In the case of our 4x4 pixel image tensor. the rank is 3. and the dimensions are 4. 4. and 3.

Sample Log of a 4x4x3 Tensor
A 4x4 pixel image with three color channels can be represented as a 3D array (or rank 3 tensor). Each pixel's color is represented by a 3-element vector (for the three color channels). and the image consists of a 4x4 grid of such pixels. giving us a shape of (4. 4. 3).

A 4x4 pixel image with 3 color channels could be represented as a 4x4x3 tensor. like this:


tensor = [
    [  # First row of pixels
        [230. 10. 10].    # Red-ish
        [230. 230. 10].  # Yellow-ish
        [10. 230. 10].   # Green-ish
        [10. 230. 230]   # Cyan-ish
    ].
    [  # Second row of pixels
        [10. 10. 230].   # Blue-ish
        [230. 10. 230].  # Magenta-ish
        [220. 220. 220]. # Light gray
        [120. 120. 120]  # Gray
    ].
    [  # Third row of pixels
        [30. 30. 30].    # Dark gray
        [230. 50. 10].   # Different shade of red
        [230. 230. 60].  # Different shade of yellow
        [10. 60. 230]    # Different shade of blue
    ].
    [  # Fourth row of pixels
        [40. 230. 40].   # Different shade of green
        [50. 10. 230].   # Another shade of blue
        [230. 40. 230].  # Another shade of magenta
        [10. 40. 10]     # Dark green
    ]
]



Clearing the Confusion Around "Dimension"
The term "dimension" can lead to some confusion. In the context of tensors. "dimension" often refers to the depth of nested lists. not the geometric or mathematical space that a vector might represent. So. a vector like [3. 4] is a rank-1 tensor (or one-dimensional array) because it involves no nesting of lists. Its shape is considered to be (2.) because it contains two elements.

In summary. tensors. while initially appearing complex. can be demystified and understood through the step-by-step breakdown of their components and properties. As multidimensional arrays. they provide the foundation for manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning. making them a fundamental concept for anyone delving into these fields.

Advanced
Exploring more properties of tensors
Understanding Covariance & Contravariance
A vector can be expressed in terms of its contravariant or covariant components

CASE 1: Expressing in terms of contravariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of components with basis vectors

üí°
We need 1 index for each of the components as there is only 1 directional indicator per component. 1 index. 1 basis vector. per component
If we decrease the length of the ‚Äúbasic vectors‚Äù (in a vector space). then the number of components required to make up a vector increases. Because the index & the number of components change contrary to each other. they are known as contravariant components of a vector Describing a vector in terms of these contravariant components (eg : 2 i + 3 j + 4 k) is how we usually describe a vectors


CASE 2: Expressing in terms of covariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of dot-product with basis vectorsIf we decrease the length of the basis vectors. then the dot-product decreases & vice versa. Since these properties are varying in the same way. we say that these are covariant components of a vector.


Specifying the notation for covariant & contravariant components


Now. say we take 2 vectors V & P

üí°
Index (for this rank 2 tensor. i.e. a vector) = unique combination of basis vectors
CASE 1: We multiply the contravariant values of V & P. On considering all possible ways. we get a matrix:

This will give us a tensor of rank 2 with 2 contra-variant index values. Here. each T value is called an element of this tensor. And since for each element. 2 indices (2 directional indicators are required) eg: Understanding by example. say we have a combination of 3 area vectors & 3 force vectors. To get the combination of all the forces on all the area vectors. for each such combination. we require 2 indices (i.e. 2 directional indicators ‚Üí 1 for the force & 1 for the area). We get 9 components. each with 2 indices (referring to 2 basis vectors)

What makes a tensor a tensor. is that. when the basis vectors change. the components of the tensor would change in the same manner as they would in one of these objects ‚Üí thus keeping the overall combination the same

What is it about the combination of components & basis vectors that makes tensors so powerful ‚Üí all observers in all reference frames agree. not on the components or the basis vectors ‚Üí but on their combinations. because they are the same

Index & Rank of tensors
üí°
Rank = the total number of indices = total number of coordinate systems (we need to have knowledge of to understand the location of the tensor) = total number of unique basis vector combinations = total number of unique linearly independent combinations = The total number of contravariant and covariant indices of a tensor.

The rank R of a tensor is independent of the number of dimensions N of the underlying space.
A tensor does not necessarily have to be created from vector components as is shown in these examples

A tensor of rank 1 is a ‚Äúvector‚Äù and has a number associated with each of the basis vectors. Only 1 index i.e. 1 combo of basis vectors is required to know the location


Here. \($V^1 = 5. V^2 = 3. V^3 = 2$\)


A tensor of rank 2 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 2 basis vectors


In a tensor of rank 3 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 3 basis vectors - composed of the components of 3 basis vectors. We can create different descriptions of this tensor by using different contravariant & covariant components of the basis vectors




More mathematical facts
While the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors. the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry. intended to represent physical space) . and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.
Objects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars. those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors. and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation. a vector v would be written $v_i$. where i=1. .... m. and matrix is a tensor of type (1.1). which would be written $a_i^j$ in tensor notation.
Tensors may be operated on by other tensors (such as metric tensors. the permutation tensor. or the Kronecker delta) or by tensor operators (such as the covariant derivative). The manipulation of tensor indices to produce identities or to simplify expressions is known as index gymnastics. which includes index lowering and index raising as special cases. These can be achieved through multiplication by a so-called metric tensor $g_{ij}. g^{ij}. g_i^j$. etc.. e.g..
Tensor notation can provide a very concise way of writing vector and more general identities. For example. in tensor notation. the dot product u¬∑v is simply written u¬∑v = $u_iv^i$ If two tensors A and B have the same rank and the same covariant and contravariant indices. then they can be added in the obvious way.
The generalization of the dot product applied to tensors is called tensor contraction. and consists of setting two unlike indices equal to each other and then summing using the Einstein summation convention. Various types of derivatives can be taken of tensors. the most common being the comma derivative and covariant derivative.
If the components of any tensor of any tensor rank vanish in one particular coordinate system. they vanish in all coordinate systems. A transformation of the variables of a tensor changes the tensor into another whose components are linear homogeneous functions of the components of the original tensor.
Tensors in the context of machine learning
The property of tensors to maintains its meaning under transformations is used also by machine learning. where real world data is transformed into corresponding tensors & then heavy calculations are done on these tensors to get valuable insights.

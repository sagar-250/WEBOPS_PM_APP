Airbnb. Stripe speak so strongly about.\n\nWhat does it mean? How does that change your workflow? What small optimizations can you do that can ensure you become such a company?\n\nYeah. you don't need a dedicated team for that - I want to list simple things you can do as a solopreneur in a garage as well.\n\nHere's 4 learnings that I've had. from my current and previous startup. on how to build a reflex muscle for customer obsession. from 120+ overall interviews I've done.\n\n0] an intro to the topic\nCustomer-centricity means you just know so much about the customer. that when you take decisions about product. you can tell exactly how your customers will react to it.\n\nIt's important because it builds very great relationship with them and they will stand by your team and product even when things don't work out that well.\n\n1] 5hrs of talktime per week\nIf you're having less than 5hrs of talktime with customers. that means you either know everything about them or you need to find a different set of people to talk to. who're willing to spend time to discuss the problem.\n\nEasy ways to get this:\n\nStart by just asking your friends for people in their companies or families for a call and ask them to connect further. If you don't know anyone. just cold reachout your competitors' customers on Linkedin\nJust ask for 25min calls. They seem shorter than 30 for some reason so I've seen people say yes and then give you the extra 5.\nAsk them to not refer to \"anyone\". but \"1 name\" that they can think of - this is fast. and has 100% success rate.\nSetup a communication channel on a platform they're most comfortable on. (Whatsapp. Telegram. Discord etc.) where you can just keep talking to them as friends\n2] Less than a day of turnaround time\nWhen you're a young company. you can provide near instanteneous customer support and that goes a long way in turning early adopters into evangelists. This is simple - just have them as priority notifications and swear you will reply something the moment you see a popup. Direct lines with founders who ping back quick feel very nice.\n\n3] Organizing their feedback\nThis is the most important part. I'm sharing my company's template for this. It's just colorful stickies you can move around. but captures certain key snippets across multiple customers really well.\n\nJust pick key sentences they say. tag and color them well - really helps a lot. Here's an example\n\n\nAt our company Recontact. we're helping people be amazing at building long-term relationships in professional and personal settings\n\nUsing this strategy. we figured out (check video) that \"Maintenance\" (i.e. keeping in touch with people) - was the most talked about point in our problem statement - because it had more stickies. And that realization saved us from spending 2 weeks worth of time in making \"Search\" in our app more efficient - because that's not what our customers cared about.\n\nSo yeah. that coloring and legend-making you did as a kid - well that's one of the key components in making a customer-centric business.\n\n4] Building a muscle for the info\nRevise. revise. revise. This. I learned from Apple CEO Tim Cook - who starts his day with reading random customer emails. Well. you can always read these stickies. Look into a simple analytics dashboard you can create for your app. - template link\n\nYou won't see it instantly. but. over time. a decision-making muscle gets built (very much like driving. music. fashion-sense) - that is very grounded in qualitative and quantitative analysis of customer feedback.\n\nListen to even the smallest details - you might not remember instantly. but then you'll be surprised how often you'll randomly remember a customer fact. when making a decision related to it.\n\nIn closing\nYou can be crazy passionate about this too - write customer snippets on your wall. listen to customer interviews at the gym. be thoughtful with delighting gifts. send personalized notes when their kids graduate etc. etc. etc.\n\nBottom line - Be close to the customer. even though the product will not work out. your company will. Business runs on trust and mutual respect.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP\nCoursepanel: My 1st startup\n31 Mar 2023 ‚Äì 6 min read\n\nProblem to Product\n27 Feb 2023 ‚Äì 6 min read\n\nLearning from Unusual Billionaires\n15 Dec 2022 ‚Äì 7 min read\n\nSee all 9 posts ‚Üí\n\nHow I learnt to do sales. starting out as a coder\nBreaking some personal barriers to actually be good at telling the world about the problem we're solving and the product we're building\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n3 MAR 2024 ‚Ä¢ 1 MIN READ\n\nLIFE\nSocial Capital\nSuperfast read on 6 ways to get more people to like you and make them strong connections.\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n21 DEC 2023 ‚Ä¢ 5 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

Here's a quick rundown of the best-selling way to build such social capital. since the past 80 years and beyond! Basically. become more likeable.\n\nThese are my key pointers from the book \"How to win friends and influence people\" by Dale Carnegie. Each topic is its own tweetstorm - so kick back and read these wisdom snippets to help you build a strong people network.\n\nWith that let's dive in by understanding 6 ways to be a person who's good at making friends.\n\n6 ways to make people like you\nüí°\n1. Become genuinely interested in other people\nA dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love\n\nYou can make more friends in 2 months by becoming interested in other people than you can. in 2 years. by trying to get other people interested in you\n\nWhen you see a group photograph that you're in. whose picture do you look for first ?\n\nIt is the individual who is not interested in his/her fellow men/women who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from such individuals that all human failures spring\n\nYou have to be interested in people if you wanna be a successful writer of stories\n\nCan win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them\n\neg : To call someone for an interview. write a letter first enclosing a list of questions that you except them to answer about themselves and their method of work\n\nTo find out someone's birthday ‚áí Begin by asking whether he/she believes the date of anyone's birth has anything to do with character or disposition\n\nA show of interest. like every other human emotion. must be sincere\n\nüí°\n2. Smile\nA smile says - \"I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you\". That is why dogs make such a hit\n\nA real smile. a heartwarming smile. a smile that comes from within. the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace\n\nPeople who smile. tend to manage. teach and sell more effectively\n\nSmile comes through in your voice\n\nHard work alone is the magic ¬†key that will unlock the door to our desires. People have succeeded because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business. As the fun becomes work. people change ‚áí lose joy in it. leading business to grow dull and fail\n\nHappiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions\n\nIt isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it. Different mental attitude\n\nAction seems to follow feeling but really. action and feeling go together and by regulating the action. which is under the more direct control of the will. we can indirectly regulate the feeling which is not\n\nThus. the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness is to sit up cheerfully and act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there\n\nMost folks are about as happy as they make up our minds to be\n\nPicture in your mind. the able. earnest. useful person you desire to be and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual\n\nA man/woman without a smiling face must not open a shop. It costs nothing but creates much\n\nüí°\n3. A person's name is to that person. the sweetest and most important sound in any language\nThe average person is more interested in his or her own name in all the other names on earth put together\nRemember that name and call it easily. and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage\nThe executive who can't remember names can't remember a significant part of his/ her business and is operating on quicksand\nTake the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds\nMost important ways of gaining good will is by remembering names and making people feel important\nTo recall a voter's name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion\nTo repeat the name several times during conversation and try to associate it with the person's features. expression and general appearance\nGood manners are made up of petty sacrifices\nMagic contained in a name should be realized as the single item. wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else.\nThe name sets the individual apart; it makes him/ her unique among all others\nThe info we are imparting or the request we are making takes on special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.\nFrom the waitress to the senior executive herself. the name will work magic as we deal with others.\nüí°\n4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves\nFew human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention\nDale Carnegie on listening and responding ‚áí Hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise\nGood conversationalists are merely good listeners who encourage a person to talk\n\"Yes. and\" - pay attention and show indications of it from time to time with approval or disapproval.\nImportant personages crave a good listener but ordinary folk do too.\n\"Many a person call a doctor when all they want is an audience\"\nIf you wanna know how to PREVENT making people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you. here is the recipe :\nAlways listen to anyone for long\nDon't talk incessantly about yourself\nIf you have an idea while the other person is talking. wait for him/ her to finish\nPeople who talk of themselves think only of themselves\nThose people who think of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. no matter how instructed they may be\nPeople you might be talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems\nTherefore. if you aspire to be a good conversationalist. be an attentive listener\nüí°\n5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests\nTheodore Roosevelt used to sit up late the night before. reading up on the subject in which he knew the guest is particularly interested in\nRoad to a person's heart is to talk about the things he/ she treasures most\nThe reward is an enlargement of life each time you speak to someone\nüí°\n6. Make the other person feel important ‚Äî and do it sincerely\nIf we are contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get somethin out of the other person in return ‚Äî we shall meet with the failure that we so richly deserve\nAttain the feeling that you have done something for him/ her without his/ her being able to do anything in return for you\nThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated ~ William James\nDo unto others and you would have others do unto you\nLittle phrases such as \"I'm sorry to trouble you\". \"Would you be so kind as to ‚Äî?\". \"Won't you please ?\". \"Would you mind\". \"Thank you ‚Äî\" little courtesies like these. oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday and. incidentally. they are the hallmark of good breeding\nThe power of honest appreciation is stupendous as everyone considers themselves imp\nEvery person I meet is my superior in some way ¬†~Emerson\nTalk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours\nIn conclusion\nBe interested. smile. remember their name. listen more. talk about their interests and make them feel important. You nail that and you find yourself as a likeable. good friend who is connected to a lot of different kinds of people very well.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN LIFE\nPhoenix Moments\n6 Jun 2022 ‚Äì 5 min read\n\n1 post ‚Üí\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nBaking customer obsession into everyday decisions\nSimple ways you can turn your project into a customer-centric product.\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n15 JAN 2024 ‚Ä¢ 3 MIN READ\n\nAR/VR\nInteractive VR app 101\nBuilding a real-world interviewer who gives good feedback\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n18 DEC 2023 ‚Ä¢ 5 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

Starting with just a laptop and a Meta Quest in your hand.\n\nHere's what the final thing looks like:\n\n\nCode\nHere's the GitHub Repo containing all the code - https://github.com/CMU-SV-Ronith/sem_3pi\n\nIntroduction to VR and AI-Generated NPCs\nVirtual Reality (VR) is transforming how we interact with digital environments. offering immersive experiences that blur the lines between the virtual and real world. One of the most exciting advancements in VR is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). especially in creating Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with users in more human-like ways. This blog post delves into the creation of an interactive AI interviewer app in VR. highlighting the technological synergy of VR and AI.\n\nChoosing the Right Engine\nWhen embarking on VR app development. selecting the right engine is crucial. Two prominent engines are Unity and Unreal. After extensive research and testing. Unity emerged as the preferable choice for several reasons:\n\nEase of Learning and Accessibility: Unity uses C#. known for its simpler syntax and automatic memory management. This choice makes Unity accessible. especially for beginners and indie developers. unlike Unreal Engine's complex C++.\nAsset Store and Community Support: Unity boasts an expansive Asset Store. providing numerous resources that speed up development. Coupled with an active community. developers have access to extensive support and shared knowledge.\nVersatility in 2D and 3D Development: Unity's proficiency in both 2D and 3D development offers flexibility. allowing developers to work on various project types without switching engines.\nPlatform Support and Integration: Unity's broad platform support. including PCs. consoles. mobile devices. and VR systems. is vital for developers targeting diverse audiences.\nStrong Documentation and Educational Resources: Unity‚Äôs comprehensive documentation and learning resources are invaluable for both beginners and experienced developers.\nMaking API Calls in C# with Code-Walkthrough\nWe code in C# in Unity. Here's a simple video on integrating Unity App with C# code that you write - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgUIx75fJ_E\n\nThis was used for the Speech Analysis and Text Analysis functions.\n\nTo integrate AI into our VR app. we need to make API calls. This is achieved through UnityEngine.Networking. setting up coroutines for HTTP(s) communications. The process involves getting and posting information. waiting for responses. and updating the UI to reflect changes. We utilize AWS for backend services and the Dolby Media Speech Analytics API for speech analysis.\n\nThe AnalyzeText coroutine sends a user's transcript to our backend for processing. while GetAnalysisResults retrieves the analysis. The AnalyseSpeech coroutine sends audio files for speech analysis. and UploadFileToS3 handles the uploading of files to AWS S3.\n\nReferences of setting up AWS in app - link. video link\n\nAPI connectors in the app\nprivate IEnumerator AnalyzeText(string transcript)\n        {\n            var requestJson = new\n            {\n                prompt = transcript\n            };\n\n            var request = new UnityWebRequest(baseUrl + \"/analyzeText\". \"POST\")\n            {\n                uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonUtility.ToJson(requestJson))).\n                downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer()\n            };\n\n            request.SetRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\". \"application/json\");\n\n            yield return request.SendWebRequest();\n\n            if (request.isNetworkError || request.isHttpError)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"Error: \" + request.error);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                string responseText = request.downloadHandler.text;\n                // Display responseText in the UI\n            }\n        }\n        private IEnumerator GetAnalysisResults()\n        {\n            var request = UnityWebRequest.Get(baseUrl + \"/getResults\");\n\n            yield return request.SendWebRequest();\n\n            if (request.isNetworkError || request.isHttpError)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"Error: \" + request.error);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                var responseJson = JsonUtility.FromJson<AnalysisResponse>(request.downloadHandler.text);\n                var analysisObject = new\n                {\n                    Loudness = responseJson.processed_region.audio.speech.details[0].loudness.measured.\n                    Confidence = responseJson.processed_region.audio.speech.details[0].sections[0].confidence.\n                    Quality = responseJson.processed_region.audio.speech.details[0].quality_score.\n                    LongestMonologue = responseJson.processed_region.audio.speech.details[0].longest_monologue\n                };\n                // Display analysisObject values in the UI\n            }\n        }\n        private IEnumerator AnalyseSpeech(string fileUrl)\n        {\n            var requestJson = new\n            {\n                input = fileUrl\n            };\n\n            var request = new UnityWebRequest(baseUrl + \"/analyseSpeech\". \"POST\")\n            {\n                uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonUtility.ToJson(requestJson))).\n                downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer()\n            };\n\n            request.SetRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\". \"application/json\");\n            request.SetRequestHeader(\"x-api-key\". \"YOUR_API_KEY\"); // Replace with your actual API key\n\n            yield return request.SendWebRequest();\n\n            if (request.isNetworkError || request.isHttpError)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"Error: \" + request.error);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                string jobId = request.downloadHandler.text;\n                // Store jobId for later use or handle it as needed\n            }\n        }\n\n\n\n        private async Task<string> UploadFileToS3(string filePath. string bucketName)\n        {\n            // Hardcoded credentials (not recommended for production)\n            string awsAccessKeyId = \"AK\";\n            string awsSecretAccessKey = \"f\";\n            AWSCredentials credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(awsAccessKeyId. awsSecretAccessKey);\n            AmazonS3Client s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(credentials.

There are several steps to a sales funnel. usually known as the top. middle. and bottom of the funnel. although these steps may vary depending on a company's sales model.\n\nA basic sales funnel can be described as consisting of 4 levels. Marketers can take inspiration from this basic structure to design a sales funnel that suits the needs of their organisation.\n\nAwareness: At the very top of the sales funnel is the awareness stage that is populated by the largest number of people. These people. not quite ready to be prospects yet. have just had their first interactions with your company and its offerings. They don‚Äôt know much about your brand at this stage. but are aware that it exists.\nInterest: The first interactions will hook some of these newly-aware people and draw them slightly deeper into the funnel. With their interest piqued. these people will spend some time getting to know more about your company and your offerings. They might browse your website or catalogue. read your blogs. or peruse reviews from past customers.\nConsideration: Armed with knowledge gathered during the interest stage. your prospects will double down on their efforts to know your company and offerings better. They may reach out to your customer service team with specific questions. or fill out a form to access more information. Remember. by this stage they may have already compared your offerings to those of your competitors. So. it is important to clearly answer their questions and help them understand how your offerings can solve their problems or needs.\nNegotiation and decision: The prospect has now almost decided to purchase your product or service. Depending on the nature of your offerings. they might begin a negotiation over the price. terms of purchase. or both. But it‚Äôs fair to assume that they have a purchase intention at this stage.\nAt the end of this stage ‚Äîthe prospect and seller have negotiated the terms of the sale to their mutual satisfaction. and the prospect pays the seller to officially become a buyer.\nExtra - Renewal or repurchase: The sale stage is not the end of the sales funnel. Soon a time will come when the sales contract is up for renewal. The customer must now decide if they want to continue with the same seller. If so. there might be a fresh round of negotiations over price and purchase terms. followed by a renewal or repurchase.\n\nHere's an image of the currently most widely used Sales tools and the stage of the funnel they're utilized in:\n\n\nWhy is a sales funnel imp?\nThat‚Äôs the value of knowing a sales funnel: Successful sellers understand the journey a prospect is likely to take before they buy. and can make sure they‚Äôre ready to move on to each stage. They‚Äôre focused on the buyer. meeting their needs in the moment and building trust that helps move the deal forward.\n\nSo what if you ditched the sales funnel? You‚Äôd run the risk of focusing too much on the close to hit quota. pushing products or services when prospects aren‚Äôt ready. Win rates would drop because prospects wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the solutions they‚Äôre offered. and trust would be lost. No long-term relationships. no cross-sells. or upsells.\n\nWhat challenges does sales have in 2023?\nChallenge 1: Standing Out From the Competition\nTo differentiate from others. salespeople should exceed prospects' expectations by being well-versed in their CRM and sales software. and staying updated with industry trends and news.\nToday. SaaS companies offer personalised email marketing. educational content. and in-depth exploratory calls with experienced representatives. Therefore. if you want to stand out from the crowd. you must be one step ahead of the already high standards of helpful. inbound selling.\nGather sales enablement materials like industry specific demos. case studies. reviews. testimonials. and analytics tools or reports.\nKeep up with industry news. trends. and reports to help prospects guide strategy and show the potential ROI to their supervisors or other decision makers.\nSet up alerts and automation to help you follow up with prospects at the right time and provide valuable resources.\nExisting tools - Apollo.io. Outreach.io\nOpportunity: This presents an opportunity to innovate in personalized and inbound selling.\nChallenge 2: Meeting Quotas\nA sales representative's best strategy for achieving quotas and converting leads is to make phone calls - whether they are selling remotely or not.\n2. Two thirds of salespeople also use discounts and promotions. and more than half report that they increase sales. The most popular promotion among sellers is bundling a suite of products. followed by free trials.\n\nChallenge 3: Getting in Direct Contact with Decision-Makers\nWith remote work becoming prevalent. establishing a strong social media presence. particularly on LinkedIn. is crucial for connecting with decision-makers.\nIn 2023. 67% of sales representatives worked under a hybrid or fully remote basis. and globally. almost 70% of professionals worked remotely. Many leaders and decision makers have physically moved to new locations farther away from their headquarters as industry events have largely shifted to virtual and hybrid formats.\nIt's crucial that salespeople establish their own presence on social media if they haven't already done so. LinkedIn was rated as the most effective platform for prospect research by nearly three quarters of sales professionals.\nChallenge 4: Lack of High-Quality Leads\nThe first place to look when dealing with lead quality issues is sales and marketing alignment. Having a shared understanding of the ideal customer profile or buyer persona for sales and marketing teams is essential.\nAssess the lifetime value of customers and which ones turn into promoters in order to develop and update these assets.\nUsing tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator. HubSpot Sales Hub. LeadIQ. and others. sales teams find and engage with prospects at the right time after identifying target customers.\nChallenge 5: Keeping Prospects Engaged Throughout the Sales Process\nIt is important to understand your buyer in terms of the bigger picture context so you can keep their interest throughout the sales process. which can be lengthy depending on the software package or service you are selling.\nIt is common for sales representatives to communicate with prospects two to seven times during B2B and B2C sales processes. which adds up when considering that most work with dozens of prospects at once.\nThe use of automated sales management tools and CRMs with lead intelligence and logging of communications with prospects (such as phone calls. emails. and actions) can help sales teams manage hundreds of data points to successfully acquire new customers.\nChallenge 6: Difficulty Getting Meetings With Prospects\nTiming is everything. Reach out at the wrong time. you‚Äôre a nuisance. Reach out at the right time. and you‚Äôre the answer to a prayer. It‚Äôs well known in the industry that the best salespeople spend most of their time on calls with prospects listening.\nIn order to secure meetings with qualified prospects. the best strategy is to listen. And to make it easy to meet with you. When listening for signals that a prospect is ready to meet. use these questions as a guide:\nSocial selling requires a combination of social media savvy and sales tools that can automatically flag key readiness indicators and send automatic alerts.\nKey insights from 30+ interviews with sales and growth teams\nOver the past 3 weeks. with conversations over 30 sales people. here are the key insights that stood out from my learnings in the current approach:\n\nEfficiency in Data Management: Many use tools like Excel and Salesforce for data organization. but there's a challenge in maintaining data hygiene and integrating personal notes effectively.\nPersonalized Customer Engagement: Sales reps emphasize personalized interactions. like remembering personal details about clients and customizing outreach. This includes tactics like social media engagement. client lunches. and gift-giving.\nUtilization of Digital Tools: Sales teams heavily rely on digital tools like CRM systems. LinkedIn Sales Navigator. and calendar reminders for tracking client interactions and industry news.\nChallenges with Remote and Hybrid Sales: Adapting to remote and hybrid sales environments is a notable challenge. affecting how sales reps connect with decision-makers and clients.\nImportance of Relationship Building: There's a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships. seen as crucial in high-value sales.\nAdapting to Market and Client Dynamics: Sales reps must adapt to changing client personnel and market conditions.\nEfficient Use of Time and Resources: Balancing time spent on tasks like data entry and client engagement is crucial. especially in cold outreach and event networking.\nConclusion\nIn summary. the sales funnel remains a vital concept in the sales process. guiding potential customers from awareness to purchase.\n\nIn 2023. sales teams face challenges like standing out from the competition. meeting quotas. and effectively engaging with decision-makers. particularly in remote and hybrid work environments.\n\nUtilizing digital tools like CRMs and LinkedIn. focusing on personalized customer engagement. and maintaining efficient data management are essential strategies. Building strong relationships and adapting to market dynamics are key to navigating these challenges.\n\nSales teams must balance innovative selling techniques with the efficient use of time and resources to succeed in the evolving sales landscape.\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hubspot-report-global-sales-trends-look-2023-iv-lead\nhttps://keap.com/product/sales-funnel\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nAR/VR\nInteractive VR app 101\nBuilding a real-world interviewer who gives good feedback\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n18 DEC 2023 ‚Ä¢ 5 MIN READ\n\nMaximizing LLM performance\nShort excerpt on how LLMs can be pushed from prototype to performance in a scalable way\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n7 NOV 2023 ‚Ä¢ 4 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

Here's the YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnGLM-RC1Y)\nIn the realm of natural language processing. optimizing large language models (LLMs) is a formidable challenge. Striking the delicate balance between performance and efficiency is akin to finding a needle in a haystack of computational complexity. The performance of LLMs. often abstract and difficult to measure. requires a nuanced approach to optimization. In this blog. we‚Äôll explore a mental model of options for LLM optimization and develop an appreciation for which option to use and when.\n\nYou will leave with a foundational understanding of the two axes of optimization‚Äîcontext and LLM behavior‚Äîas well as a practical guide to the nuanced world of model refinement.\n\nThe Twin Axes of Optimization\n\n1. Context Optimization\nAt its core. context optimization is about fine-tuning what the model needs to know. Here‚Äôs how you can approach it:\n\nPrompt Engineering: As the lower-left quadrant in our optimization matrix. prompt engineering is your fast lane to setting a baseline. Start by refining the prompts you feed into the LLM and observe the performance changes.\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Positioned in the upper-left. RAG introduces more context. Begin with simple retrieval mechanisms. and consider fine-tuning for a more nuanced approach.\n2. LLM Behavior Optimization\nLLM behavior optimization delves into how the model should act. The two main strategies are:\n\nFine-tuning: The lower-right quadrant represents fine-tuning. which customizes the LLM‚Äôs behavior for specific tasks.\nComprehensive Approach: Sometimes. a combination of all methods is required to reach the desired performance level. An example would be integrating HyDE retrieval with a fact-checking step.\nThe key is to start somewhere. evaluate. and then iterate with another method.\n\nStrategies Explored\nPrompt Engineering: The Starting Block\nStarting with clear. concise instructions and breaking down complex tasks into simpler subtasks is paramount. Giving models \"time to think\" and testing changes systematically can yield surprising improvements. Extending this by providing reference text and using external tools can further enhance the results.\n\n\nWhen It Shines:\n\nQuick testing and learning\nEstablishing a baseline for further optimization\nIts Limitations:\n\nIntroducing new information\nReplicating complex styles or methodologies\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation: Expanding Knowledge\nBy giving LLMs access to domain-specific content. RAG helps update the model's knowledge and control the content it generates to reduce inaccuracies.\n\n\nWhen It Shines:\n\nIntroducing new. specific information\nControlling content to reduce errors\nIts Limitations:\n\nBroad domain understanding\nLearning new languages. formats. or styles\nEnhancing RAG:\n\nEmploy retrieval with cosine similarity and HyDE\nExperiment with FT embeddings and chunking\nImplement reranking and classification steps\nEvaluating RAG:\n\nOn the LLM side. consider the faithfulness and relevance of the answers.\nOn the content side. assess the precision and recall of the context retrieved. More data does not necessarily equate to higher accuracy.\n\nFine-tuning: The Custom Tailor\nWhen prompt engineering doesn't cut it. fine-tuning may be the right path. Continuing the training process with domain-specific data can optimize model performance and efficiency. For example. Canva leveraged fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to produce structured output. showcasing the power of high-quality training data.\n\n\nWhen It Shines:\n\nEmphasizing existing knowledge\nCustomizing response structure or tone\nIts Limitations:\n\nInjecting new knowledge into the model\nQuick iterations on new use-cases\nSteps to Fine-tune:\n\nData preparation\nHyperparameter selection and loss function understanding during training\nEvaluation with relevant test sets and expert opinion\nFine-tuning Best Practices:\n\nStart with prompt engineering\nEstablish a clear baseline\nPrioritize quality over quantity in training data\n\nThe Combined Approach: Fine-tuning + RAG\nSometimes. a blend of fine-tuning and RAG yields the best results. This method allows the model to understand complex instructions with minimal tokens. creating more space for retrieved context and leading to a more robust performance.\n\n\n\n\nPractical Application\nThe real-world application of these strategies can be as creative as generating hypothetical answers to enhance similarity searches. For example. initial baselines might yield a 69% performance rate. while a RAG with a well-crafted answer could increase that to 84%. comparable to fine-tuning. Collaborations. such as the one between Scale AI and OpenAI. demonstrate how a combined approach can optimize models to new heights of efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n\nCareful what you fine-tune on\nIn conclusion. maximizing LLM performance isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all endeavor. It requires a toolkit of strategies‚Äîfrom prompt engineering to fine-tuning and beyond‚Äîeach with its own set of benefits and best-use scenarios.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nSALE\nThe state of sales in 2023\nThe current approach. tools and terminology. key insights. challenges and opportunities available in the sales domain\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n17 NOV 2023 ‚Ä¢ 6 MIN READ\n\nEDUCATION\nBuildSchool - bet on student projects\nHow to inspire students to take a bet on themselves and build something 0 to 1\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n3 NOV 2023 ‚Ä¢ 5 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

Something that makes them laugh and cry and hope and bond and stay up late in teams and chase self-assigned deadlines and ship something they would have never thought they could.\n\nthat was the ideal of buildschool.\n\nwe wanted to give students \"an ecosystem of believer-builders who built things to solve problems because they wanted to\". and having friends around always helps.\n\nbut the issue was. we were targeting a student base who had just come back from remote learning. who was not entirely immersed into this tinkering culture and was more driven by definite career paths.\n\nin April 2022. Technical Society (TechSoc) started with minimal funding. full motivation and targeted growth hacks. to grow a strong community. I think the best takebacks from this journey are perseverence. dealing with ambiguity. and faith in the dreamers of tomorrow.\n\nand our approach at TechSoc has always been - invest in the team. invest in the participants and invest in the future. here's 3 stages of how we built a community from scratch and run it well. to this day.\n\nüí°\nThis journey was only possible due to the amazing contribution by Anouksha Hemanth. Prabhat Bedida. Subham Sagar. Yashaswi. Piyush Agrawal. Nikshay Jain. Vishwajeet. GK Harish and several others who made this vision real.¬†\nbuilding a team\nfirst. we had to make team buildschool believe that the mission they were solving was important because they would be enablers of a movement much bigger than themselves. so Anouksha and me used YCombinator's startup school curriculum and actually had each manager at buildschool study startup from a perspective of product strategy. history. revenue and future steps. this helped them understand how products are built. gain confidence in talking more about these ideas and also be better thinkers in general. over 2.5 months we did multiple startup teardowns. had these people practice cold emailing founders and speaking comfortably with them. here are some of their early day case studies.\n\nonce our little army was ready. it was time to go to war. boy. was it going to be brutal.\n\ninspiring a community\nthe early days were very random and we had barely any clue of processes and contacts and pretty much anything. we were just very clear on what we had to solve - get 10 student prototypes. not powerpoints. out by the next 13 weeks.\n\nto begin with. the issue was. how do you even get people to care to solve problems? it was always cooler to do fancy PoRs that add sure-shot resume points as opposed to taking a bet on whether you and your buddies could build something or not\n\nand even if people do care. how do you get them to actually learn this process of product building - right from design. to shipping to release to iteration and beyond? well. the answer actually lies in inspiring people.\n\nas Simon Sinek says. if you connect with the \"why\" of people. you can truly move them to do unbelievable things. and we did all sorts of crazy things to get the message across. here's a video from the early days. just a whiteboard. an ai generated thumbnail and some students talking about a crazy vision of 10 teams. 10 weeks. 10 prototypes.\n\n\nwe did speak to people and touch upon a nerve.\n\nto further this. we revived the history of the \"fun in building\" through our alumnus Kedar Kulkarni - who started off with very realistic stories of moving up the quality ladder by building computer vision fun-tools with his friends and then moving up to govt partnerships and funded projects. looking back. i think that may have struck a really strong chord - even in me.\n\n\nsomething to remind students of where the foundation of innovation lies\nsustaining the experience\n10 teams selected. basic application on their plan for 10 weeks. we were just looking for grit.\n\nto refine our teams. buildschool organized really amazing talks right from product research and UI designing. all the way up to engineering and growth post launch. we got CXOs and industry veterans to give talks for free - how did we do that? well. we just connected with the \"why\" of these disruptors through a cold email as simple as:\n\n\nthe thing that sold best was the thought of inspiring students to build more\nboom! 7 high quality lectures in various domains - all conducted at zero cost. well. except for the food. it does not have to be complex - ¬†\n\ngrowth hack - give people free food and they show up the 1st time. give them a memorable experience and they will keep showing up again and again.\n\n\ngive them pizza and they'll do amazing things\nand it was hard. students want to do all sorts of things at all times. so we used accountability partners called \"build buds\" for each team to navigate through getting the right resources. connected to the right folks. and even actually finishing right before deadlines.\n\nguess what - at a mini demo day amongst the teams - 9 of them had a functioning product! here's a random picture from the mini demo day at the 8 week mark.\n\ninvesting in the future\nby the time the 10th week ended. teams had transformed beyond what we had thought. people who didn't know coding had built apps. people who were shy on stage were presenting. people who were unsure about their passions had picked up something new and built something meaningful out of it. well. and the buildschool team - they had gone through the extreme rollercoaster of 0 attendee events (that really happened. it was really stressful) to having a great turnout of 9 products built in those 10 weeks and then we came for a repeat in the upcoming semesters with even more student interest. what makes me smile the most. is that people actually now think of this as a thing they can do full time.\n\n\nend of buildsprint #1. november 2022\nfun fact. one team even got incubated in the startup accelerator at IIT Madras. i look forward to more such stories.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è here's my takeaway - atleast once in life. i feel. every person must go through the pain and the fulfilment of building something from 0 to 1. because once you're on the other side of the storm - you gain the self-confidence to do anything you want.\n\nthat's what our vision at techsoc always has been. cheers and happy building!\n\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN EDUCATION\nCan VR revolutionize education?\n4 Oct 2023 ‚Äì 10 min read\n\nOle ole Alakananda\n27 Jul 2023 ‚Äì 5 min read\n\nThe Next Decade of Indian Higher Education\n30 Oct 2022 ‚Äì 8 min read\n\nSee all 3 posts ‚Üí\n\nMaximizing LLM performance\nShort excerpt on how LLMs can be pushed from prototype to performance in a scalable way\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n7 NOV 2023 ‚Ä¢ 4 MIN READ\n\nMACHINE LEARNING\nHuggingSage\nUsing Amazon Sagemaker to deploy whichever Hugging Face models you want. along with API inference\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n22 OCT 2023 ‚Ä¢ 8 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

This will allow you to manage access and track your experiments.\n\nStep 2a: Deploy the Llama2 Model\nAfter setting up your domain and user. head over to the SageMaker console. Look for the \"Sagemaker Jumpstart\" section. and from there. choose to deploy the \"llama 7b model.\" This process usually takes about seven minutes. and at the end of it. you'll be provided with an endpoint name. Make a note of this. as it will be essential for the next steps.\n\nStep 2b: Integrating any Huggingface Model with Amazon Sagemaker\nInstead of Amazon Sagemaker Jumpstart model options. you can also bring any HuggingFace model too and have it setup. Here's how\n\n1. Setup development environment\nWe are going to use the sagemaker python SDK to deploy Llama 2 to Amazon SageMaker. We need to make sure to have an AWS account configured and the sagemaker python SDK installed.\n\nimport sagemaker\nimport boto3\nsess = sagemaker.Session()\n# sagemaker session bucket -> used for uploading data. models and logs\n# sagemaker will automatically create this bucket if it not exists\nsagemaker_session_bucket=None\nif sagemaker_session_bucket is None and sess is not None:\n    # set to default bucket if a bucket name is not given\n    sagemaker_session_bucket = sess.default_bucket()\n\n    \n    \ndef setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Params:\n    - default_bucket: Default bucket name to use for the session\n\n    Returns:\n    - session: SageMaker session object\n    - role_arn: ARN of the IAM execution role\n    \"\"\"\n    global sagemaker_execution_role\n    session = sagemaker.Session(default_bucket=default_bucket)\n\n    try:\n        sagemaker_execution_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()\n    except ValueError:\n        iam = boto3.client('iam')\n        sagemaker_execution_role = iam.get_role(RoleName=\"sagemaker_execution_role\")['Role']['Arn']\n\n    return session. sagemaker_execution_role\n\ndef mask_account_id(account_id):\n    return '*' * len(account_id)\n\ndef main():\n    sagemaker_session_bucket = None\n\n    session. sagemaker_execution_role = setup_sagemaker_session(default_bucket=sagemaker_session_bucket)\n\n    # Mask it\n    account_id = sagemaker_execution_role.split(':')[4]\n    masked_account_id = mask_account_id(account_id)\n    masked_role = sagemaker_execution_role.replace(account_id. masked_account_id)\n\n    print(f\"SageMaker role ARN: {masked_role}\")\n    print(f\"SageMaker session region: {session.boto_region_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n2. Retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC\nCompared to deploying regular Hugging Face models we first need to retrieve the container uri and provide it to our HuggingFaceModel model class with a image_uri pointing to the image. To retrieve the new Hugging Face LLM DLC in Amazon SageMaker. we can use the get_huggingface_llm_image_uri method provided by the sagemaker SDK. This method allows us to retrieve the URI for the desired Hugging Face LLM DLC based on the specified backend. session. region. and version. You can find the available versions here\n\nfrom sagemaker.huggingface import get_huggingface_llm_image_uri\n\n\n## Fetch docker image URI for the Hugging Face DLC:\n# 1. backend name\n# 2. Hugging face LDC version\n\n\n# retrieve the llm image uri\nllm_image = get_huggingface_llm_image_uri(\n  \"huggingface\".\n  version=\"0.9.3\"\n)\n\n# print ecr image uri\nprint(f\"llm image uri: {llm_image}\")\n\nHardware Requirements\nLlama 2 comes in 3 different sizes - 7B. 13B & 70B parameters. The hardware requirements will vary based on the model size deployed to SageMaker. Below is a set up minimum requirements for each model size we tested.\n\nNote: We haven't tested GPTQ models yet.\n\nMODEL\tINSTANCE TYPE\tQUANTIZATION\t# OF GPUS PER REPLICA\nLlama 7B\t(ml.)g5.2xlarge\t-\t1\nLlama 13B\t(ml.)g5.12xlarge\t-\t4\nLlama 70B\t(ml.)g5.48xlarge\tbitsandbytes\t8\nLlama 70B\t(ml.)p4d.24xlarge\t-\t8\nNote: Amazon SageMaker currently doesn't support instance slicing meaning. e.g. for Llama 70B you cannot run multiple replica on a single instance.\n\nThese are the minimum setups we have validated for 7B. 13B and 70B LLaMA 2 models to work on SageMaker. In the coming weeks. we plan to run detailed benchmarking covering latency and throughput numbers across different hardware configurations. We are currently not recommending deploying Llama 70B to g5.48xlarge instances. since long request can timeout due to the 60s request timeout limit for SageMaker. Use p4d instances for deploying Llama 70B it.\n\nIt might be possible to run Llama 70B on g5.48xlarge instances without quantization by reducing the MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS and MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS parameters. We haven't tested this yet.\n\n# confirm requirements met for kernel\nimport json\n\ndef get_instance_type_from_metadata():\n    with open('/opt/ml/metadata/resource-metadata.json') as f:\n        metadata = json.load(f)\n        resource_name = metadata.get('ResourceName'. '')\n    return resource_name\n\ndef main():\n    resource_name = get_instance_type_from_metadata()\n\n    # List valid instance types\n    valid_instance_types = ['ml.g5.12xlarge'. 'ml.g5-48xlarge']\n\n    if any(instance_type in resource_name for instance_type in valid_instance_types):\n        print(\"Instance configured correctly\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Need to upgrade to at least 'ml.g5.12xlarge' instance\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n4. Deploy Llama2 to Amazon Sagemaker\nTo deploy meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf to Amazon SageMaker we create a HuggingFaceModel model class and define our endpoint configuration including the hf_model_id. instance_type etc. We will use a g5.12xlarge instance type. which has 4 NVIDIA A10G GPUs and 96GB of GPU memory.\n\nNote: This is a form to enable access to Llama 2 on Hugging Face after you have been granted access from Meta. Please visit the Meta website and accept our license terms and acceptable use policy before submitting this form. Requests will be processed in 1-2 days.\n\nimport json\nimport getpass\nfrom sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel\n\n\ndef get_sagemaker_config():\n    # sagemaker config\n    instance_type = \"ml.p4d.24xlarge\"\n    number_of_gpu = 8\n    health_check_timeout = 300\n\n    # Define Model and Endpoint configuration parameter\n    config = {\n      'HF_MODEL_ID': \"meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\". # model_id from hf.co/models\n      'SM_NUM_GPUS': json.dumps(number_of_gpu). # Number of GPU used per replica\n      'MAX_INPUT_LENGTH': json.dumps(2048).  # Max length of input text\n      'MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(4096).  # Max length of the generation (including input text)\n      'MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS': json.dumps(8192).  # Limits the number of tokens that can be processed in parallel during the generation\n      'HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN': getpass.getpass(\"Enter your Hugging Face hub token\")\n      # .'HF_MODEL_QUANTIZE': \"bitsandbytes\". # comment in to quantize\n    }\n    return instance_type. health_check_timeout. config\n\ndef create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. image_uri):\n    # check if token is set\n    assert config['HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN'] != \"\". \"Please set your Hugging Face Hub token\"\n\n    # create HuggingFaceModel with the image uri\n    llm_model = HuggingFaceModel(\n      role=role.\n      image_uri=llm_image.\n      env=config\n    )\n    return llm_model\n\n\ndef main():\n    instance_type. health_check_timeout. config = get_sagemaker_config()\n    \n    # Set role and image_uri\n    role = sagemaker_execution_role\n    llm_image_to_ref = llm_image\n    \n    # Declare llm model with create_hugging_face_model module\n    llm_model = create_huggingface_model(instance_type. config. role. llm_image_to_ref)\n    \n    # Deploy model to the endpoint if llm_model is available\n    if llm_model:\n            llm = llm_model.deploy(\n                initial_instance_count = 1.\n                instance_type=instance_type.\n                container_startup_health_check_timeout=health_check_timeout\n            )\n            \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n5. Run inference and chat with the model\n5. Run inference and chat with the model\nAfter our endpoint is deployed we can run inference on it. We will use the predict method from the predictor to run inference on our endpoint. We can inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload. As of today the TGI supports the following parameters:\n\ntemperature: Controls randomness in the model. Lower values will make the model more deterministic and higher values will make the model more random. Default value is 1.0.\nmax_new_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate. Default value is 20. max value is 512.\nrepetition_penalty: Controls the likelihood of repetition. defaults to null.\nseed: The seed to use for random generation. default is null.\nstop: A list of tokens to stop the generation. The generation will stop when one of the tokens is generated.\ntop_k: The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. Default value is null. which disables top-k-filtering.\ntop_p: The cumulative probability of parameter highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for nucleus sampling. default to null.\ndo_sample: Whether or not to use sampling ; use greedy decoding otherwise. Default value is false.\nbest_of: Generate best_of sequences and return the one if the highest token logprobs. default to null.\ndetails: Whether or not to return details about the generation. Default value is false.\nreturn_full_text: Whether or not to return the full text or only the generated part. Default value is false.\ntruncate: Whether or not to truncate the input to the maximum length of the model. Default value is true.\ntypical_p: The typical probability of a token. Default value is null.\nwatermark: The watermark to use for the generation. Default value is false.\nYou can find the open api specification of the TGI in the swagger documentation\n\nThe meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf is a conversational chat model meaning we can chat with it using the following prompt:\n\n[INST] <> {{ system_prompt }} <>\n\n{{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} [INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]\n\nWe create a small helper method build_llama2_prompt. which converts a List of \"messages\" into the prompt format. We also define a system_prompt which is used to start the conversation. We will use the system_prompt to ask the model about some cool ideas to do in the summer.\n\ndef build_llama2_prompt(messages):\n    startPrompt = \"<s>[INST] \"\n    endPrompt = \" [/INST]\"\n    conversation = []\n    for index. message in enumerate(messages):\n        if message[\"role\"] == \"system\" and index == 0:\n            conversation.append(f\"<<SYS>>\\n{message['content']}\\n<</SYS>>\\n\\n\")\n        elif message[\"role\"] == \"user\":\n            conversation.append(message[\"content\"].strip())\n        else:\n            conversation.append(f\" [/INST] {message['content'].strip()} </s><s>[INST] \")\n\n    return startPrompt + \"\".join(conversation) + endPrompt\n  \nmessages = [\n  { \"role\": \"system\".\"content\": \"You are a friendly and knowledgeable vacation planning assistant named Clara. Your goal is to have natural conversations with users to help them plan their perfect vacation. \"}\n]\n# define question and add to messages\ninstruction = \"What are some cool ideas to do in the summer?\"\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"user\". \"content\": instruction})\nprompt = build_llama2_prompt(messages)\n\nchat = llm.predict({\"inputs\":prompt})\n\nprint(chat[0][\"generated_text\"][len(prompt):])\nNow we will run inference with different parameters to impact the generation. Parameters can be defined as in the parameters attribute of the payload.\n\n# hyperparameters for llm\npayload = {\n  \"inputs\":  prompt.\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"do_sample\": True.\n    \"top_p\": 0.6.\n    \"temperature\": 0.9.\n    \"top_k\": 50.\n    \"max_new_tokens\": 512.\n    \"repetition_penalty\": 1.03.\n    \"stop\": [\"</s>\"]\n  }\n}\n\n\n# send request to endpoint\nresponse = llm.predict(payload)\n\nprint(response[0][\"generated_text\"][len(prompt):])\nStep 3: Integrate with AWS Lambda\nWith your model deployed and the endpoint name at hand. navigate to AWS Lambda. Here. create a function that calls this endpoint. Below is the Python code for the Lambda function that invokes the SageMaker endpoint:\n\nimport json\nimport boto3\n\nENDPOINT_NAME=\"jumpstart-dft-meta-textgeneration-llama-2-7b\"\nruntime= boto3.client('runtime.sagemaker')\n\ndef lambda_handler(event. context):\n    data = event[\"body\"]\n    print(data)\n    \n    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME.\n        ContentType='application/json'.\n        Body=data.\n        CustomAttributes=\"accept_eula=true\"\n    )\n    \n    response_content = response['Body'].read().decode()\n    result = json.loads(response_content)\n    \n    return {\n        'statusCode': 200.\n        'body': json.dumps(result)\n    }\nStep 4: Grant Necessary Permissions\nFor your Lambda function to work correctly. it requires specific permissions to invoke the SageMaker endpoint. To grant these permissions. create an inline policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) with the following JSON:\n\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\".\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\".\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\".\n      \"Action\": \"sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint\".\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nStep 5: Expose Lambda Function as an API\nOnce your function is ready and permissions are in place. expose this Lambda function as a URL. This makes it accessible over the web and can be called using common web tools.\n\nStep 6: Testing Your Deployment\nTo test the setup. use a curl command. like the one below:\n\ncurl --location 'https://khhg37edhrmibhj4ahsxqnqlha0qoqqc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\n    \"inputs\":\"I believe the meaning of life is\".\n    \"parameters\":{\n        \"max_new_tokens\":256.\n        \"top_p\":0.9.\n        \"temperature\":0.6\n    }\n}'\nThis command sends a POST request to your Lambda function. which in turn invokes the SageMaker endpoint and returns the model's prediction.\n\nIn Conclusion\nSetting up a machine learning model and exposing it as an API using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart and AWS Lambda is a straightforward process. It offers scalability and ease of integration. making it suitable for a range of applications.

Mel Slater's 2016 research emphasizes VR's potential for implicit learning. making abstract concepts tangible and enhancing understanding. Platforms like Bodyswaps. combined with Oculus VR headsets. promise innovative soft skill training. The booming VR market. projected to reach $165.91 billion by 2030. testifies to its growing influence. Comprehensive research objectives have been outlined. focusing on long-term effectiveness. personalization. inclusivity. cost implications. and device efficacy. The research aims to ensure VR's effectiveness and relevance in the rapidly evolving professional world.\n\nProblem Selection\n1.1 Statement\nVirtual Reality (VR) offers a transformative approach to education. expanding the boundaries of traditional learning. Mel Slater's 2016 paper. \"Implicit Learning through Embodiment in Immersive Virtual Reality.\" elucidates this potential by delving into the concept of implicit learning. where individuals acquire knowledge without conscious awareness (Slater. 2016). VR's immersive nature is largely attributed to two illusions: Place Illusion (PI) and Plausibility Illusion (Psi). PI gives users the sensation of being in a virtual environment. leveraging the body's natural perception methods. while Psi makes events in VR feel authentic (Slater. 2016). The sense of embodiment. where one's physical body is substituted by a virtual counterpart. enhances this immersion.\n\n1.2 Understanding the Potential\nThe educational potential of VR is highlighted by its ability to transform abstract concepts into tangible experiences. Instead of mere observation. students can actively participate. visualizing and manipulating realities that would be otherwise challenging or impossible in the physical world. Such hands-on experiences advance explanations and deepen understanding (Slater. 2016). The incorporation of VR in education also shifts the pedagogical paradigm. placing students at the focal point of instructional attention.\n\nAnother study examining the efficacy of VR in K-12 and higher education found VR-based instruction significantly impacts various learning outcomes (Effectiveness of virtual reality-based instruction). Factors like learning outcome measures. type of learning tasks. and feedback mechanisms moderate the effectiveness of VR instruction. suggesting a tailored approach to VR integration can yield optimal results.\n\nThe expanding VR market. projected to grow from $25.11 billion in 2023 to $165.91 billion by 2030. underscores its burgeoning influence (TAM). Specifically. the VR education segment is expected to reach a valuation of $46.14B by 2027 (SAM). Such growth is indicative of VR's increasing integration in diverse sectors. including education.\n\nMoreover. the unique data potential of VR. as seen in a 2023 study where motion data allowed researchers to identify users with over 94% accuracy. promises personalized learning experiences. enhancing user engagement and facilitating predictive analytics. Such data-driven insights can quantify skill development. bolstering stakeholder confidence and paving the way for novel monetization strategies.\n\n1.2 On Bodyswaps and Meta\nBodyswaps. a cutting-edge VR training platform. specializes in honing soft skills through immersive simulations. enabling learners to practice. receive feedback. and even view their interactions from another's perspective. This innovative approach to learning facilitates deep introspection and skill enhancement. When integrated with Meta's Reality Labs' Oculus VR headsets. users can experience Bodyswaps' transformative training in a seamlessly immersive environment. The synergy between Bodyswaps and Oculus could redefine soft skill training. making it more accessible. effective. and in tune with the digital age's demands. This partnership promises a future where learning transcends traditional boundaries. merging technology with human-centric education.\n\n1.2 Reflection\nVirtual Reality (VR) is revolutionizing the educational landscape by transcending traditional learning boundaries. Slater's 2016 research highlighted the immersive potential of VR. emphasizing implicit learning and embodiment. The integration of VR into education promotes experiential learning. making abstract concepts tangible. The booming VR market. expected to reach $165.91 billion by 2030. emphasizes its growing significance. Moreover. platforms like Bodyswaps. when combined with Oculus VR headsets. promise innovative soft skill training. blending technological advancements with human-centric educational approaches. The future of learning seems to be at the cusp of a VR-driven transformation.\n\nUnderstanding the data\n2.1 Insights from current data\nThe current data offers a multitude of insights. Personalization is at the forefront. with data distinguishing between identified and anonymous users. potentially facilitating targeted feedback. Device-specific data can elucidate how different hardware affects user experiences. Furthermore. module-specific IDs enable segmentation based on the soft skill being trained. The diverse range of event verbs and time-stamped data illuminates user interactions and pace of learning. respectively. The metadata's complexity offers an opportunity for detailed event analysis. while the \"context\" field provides both structured and intuitive data analysis. The grading system in the 'Scored' event can provide immediate feedback. and the data under \"conversed\" and \"said\" events can be pivotal in analyzing user decision-making patterns. The presence of the \"segmented\" event also hints at the platform's capability to conduct A/B testing. fostering continuous module improvement.\n\n2.2 Where is VR most effective\nVR's efficacy shines in scenarios demanding an immersive experience. such as public speaking or job interviews. where environment and ambiance play a pivotal role. It excels in behavioral training. especially in modules like \"Active Listening\" or \"Inclusive Leadership.\" enabling users to practice interpersonal interactions in a controlled setting. Additionally. VR proves highly beneficial in feedback-driven scenarios. For instance. modules like \"Navigating Microaggressions\" can benefit from VR's ability to simulate intricate social situations and deliver instantaneous. data-driven feedback.\n\n2.3 What Student Demographics?\nYoung Adults/Recent Graduates:\nBeneficial for those entering the workforce.\nModules such as \"enteringTheWorkforce\" and \"jobInterviewSkills\" are particularly relevant.\nMid-Career Professionals:\nModules like \"Inclusive Leadership\" and \"Navigating Microaggressions\" cater to those aiming for leadership roles or professional growth.\nDiverse Backgrounds:\nThe system captures demographic data. including gender and racial group.\nOpportunities exist to examine training effectiveness across various demographic segments.\n\n2.4 What are Attitudes Towards VR for Soft-Skill Development?\nTo gauge attitudes towards VR for soft-skill development. one can utilize the \"Rated\" event. which provides feedback on the VR experience. Metrics like \"Duration.\" \"EyeContactTime.\" and \"Participation\" can be indicative of users' engagement and their positive inclination towards VR training. Integrating post-training surveys under the \"postsurvey\" context can shed light on user recommendations. understanding. and engagement. Moreover. conducting qualitative interviews with users who have completed multiple modules can offer deeper insights into their attitudes and experiences with the VR platform.\n\n2.5 Reflection\nThe data underscores the nuanced capabilities of the VR platform. emphasizing personalization. user experience adaptation based on device usage. and in-depth analysis of user interactions. VR's strength is evident in its immersive nature. transforming traditional learning scenarios like public speaking into rich. experiential sessions. It becomes apparent that VR holds particular promise for young professionals and those seeking leadership growth. The platform's design also suggests a keen interest in understanding user attitudes towards VR for soft-skill development. The integration of feedback mechanisms and in-depth interviews displays a commitment to refining the platform based on user experiences and perceptions.\n\nImproving customer discovery with metrics\n\n3.1 Useful metrics to capture\nSpeech Confidence Metrics:\n\nThe platform measures an individual's command over language. nervousness. clarity. and emotional state. Metrics include speech rate. the frequency and duration of pauses. changes in speech pace. and speech clarity. Vocal fillers. variability in speech rate. and fluency are also tracked. The complexity of vocabulary and structure. the tone of speech. and syntactic complexity further shed light on an individual's speech confidence.\n\nNonverbal Behavior Metrics:\n\nNonverbal behaviors are essential indicators of a speaker‚Äôs influence. rapport with the audience. and overall comfort. Metrics include eye contact duration. the frequency of gestures. posture changes. and smiling frequency. The platform also tracks fidgeting. head nodding. gaze direction. arm movement range. pacing. and whether the speaker exhibits open or closed body language.\n\nVoice Analysis Metrics:\n\nThe platform delves into the intricacies of a speaker's voice. assessing pitch variability. volume changes. and spectral energy distribution. The rate of speech variability. intensity. and signs of vocal fatigue are also measured. Moreover. breathing patterns. voice tremors. speaking rate consistency. and vocal resonance quality are analyzed to provide comprehensive feedback.\n\nEmotional Expression Metrics:\n\nEmotions play a pivotal role in communication. The platform captures changes in facial expressions. the intensity of emotions. and the accuracy of emotion recognition. Shifts between positive and negative emotions. the speed of emotion transitions. congruence with speech. and patterns of emotional valence and arousal are assessed. Time intervals between different emotional expressions and synchronization with audience reactions provide a holistic view of emotional expression.\n\nAudience Engagement Metrics:\n\nAudience engagement metrics provide insights into the speaker's effectiveness in maintaining attention. The platform measures interaction rates. audience response rates. and the time taken to respond to questions. Attention spans. feedback sentiments. engagement patterns. interaction consistency. and audience reaction times are also tracked. Additional metrics evaluate the quality of audience questions and the rate of interruptions.\n\nSpeech Content Metrics:\n\nThe content of a speech is fundamental. Metrics include clarity scores. transcript coherence. use of technical jargon. and the organization of the speech. Effectiveness of visual aids. verbal repetition. alignment with a prepared script. word choice. and engagement phrases are also assessed. The platform also evaluates the appropriateness of speech length relative to content.\n\nFace Tracking:\n\nQuest Pro's Face Tracking API detects facial movements. converting them into expressions like jaw dropping or nose wrinkling.This data offers insights into Engagement and Emotional Responses. Metrics derived include Facial Expression changes. Emotion congruence with speech. and Emotion duration & intensity. Facial expressions indicate user engagement. crucial for business retention and understanding user behaviors. They also serve as primary indicators for emotions. facilitating deeper user behavior interpretation.\n\nOverall Performance Metrics:\n\nThe platform provides an overarching evaluation of a speaker's performance. Metrics include alignment of speech duration with the agenda. audience retention. and content recall. The effectiveness of using the virtual environment. adaptability to unexpected scenarios. use of audience feedback. and smooth transitions are also evaluated.

Our perception plays a pivotal role in determining how we steer our ship into the future.\n\nMental Maps and Perceptions\nAs individuals. we need to acknowledge that our understanding of the future is inevitably tinted by personal perceptions and biases. not objective truths. Each person's mental map. the internal framework we use to navigate decisions. varies. and these maps significantly influence the decisions made regarding the future.\n\nThe Risk of Success\nIronically. success might be one of our biggest stumbling blocks. Past triumphs can make us overly reliant on the mental maps that brought us to our current position. A strategy that yielded success in the past isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work indefinitely. and overconfidence in these tried-and-tested mental maps might blind us to other possibilities and opportunities.\n\nThe Pitfall of Incorrect Maps\nAs the legend goes. the first set of Spanish voyagers actually thought that there was a water body connecting south-west and north-west coast of USA. And they made a wrong map. with full confidence. not knowing their mistake. Fun fact. until 16 years. voyagers used the wrong map and after multiple complaints. they were finally able to break the mental model of the government to actually update the map. And that process took 160 years total. The story of the erroneous map of the USA. used for 160 years due to stubborn belief in its accuracy. serves as a telling example. An incorrect understanding leads to misguided actions. and once a particular map (or belief) is accepted. altering it becomes a formidable challenge.\n\nAsking Uncomfortable Questions\nFuturecasting is not about comfort; it's about preparedness and openness to disquieting truths. It requires us to challenge our convictions and ask questions that make us squirm. This process involves thinking divergently about what lies ahead. questioning the mental maps we hold dear. and being willing to redraw them as needed.\n\nNavigating with Awareness\nMuch like skilled sailors navigating the waters with an acute awareness of tides and winds. individuals and organizations need to craft strategies with a deep understanding of global currents and shifts. Where you eventually land is a result of both your goals and the global factors that either facilitate or hinder your journey.\n\nCase in Point: The Oil Business\n\nA look at the oil industry. where success is traditionally measured by rig count. reveals a critical mistake. Businesses often take one scenario. tweak it slightly. and convince themselves that they are working with different models. However. slight variations of a single view do not capture the diversity and unpredictability of the real world.\n\nLearning from IBM\n\nA picture from forecasting by an IBM leader. saying that PCs weren't a good enough market\nIBM‚Äôs monumental miscalculation of the PC market potential‚Äîestimated at a few hundred thousand dollars. while the real value was a staggering $30 million‚Äîcost them dearly. The mental maps of their strategists. albeit successful in the past. failed to envision a scenario where PCs would be ubiquitous. missing out on a colossal opportunity and leaving an estimated $200 billion on the table - $100 billion for the software OS (Windows. then called MS-DOS) and $100 billion for the chip making market (that Intel captured)\n\nScenario Thinking: An Essential Tool\nTo prevent these decision traps. scenario thinking is invaluable. It helps to mitigate overconfidence. encourages outside-in thinking. enables seeing the full picture. corrects problem framing. and promotes asking the right questions. The goal is not to predict the future accurately but to ask better. more insightful questions. to prepare for a variety of possible futures.\n\n\nConclusion\nFuturecasting. therefore. is a dance between confidence and humility. knowledge and curiosity. planning and flexibility. It's about continually asking \"what if\" and being prepared to redraw your mental maps to navigate the thrilling. unpredictable. and often unthinkable tides of the future. Let's escape the confines of our minds and be open to the vast. exciting possibilities the future holds.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nAR/VR\nCan VR revolutionize education?\nA case study on how simulated environments in VR can be used to track the implicit learning experiences\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n4 OCT 2023 ‚Ä¢ 10 MIN READ\n\nImpact of Technology on Employability and Wealth\nUnderstanding what the future of work and employment could be like. given advancements in tech\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n2 SEP 2023 ‚Ä¢ 3 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

We talk about how technology shifts have been there. but this time its different. Today there are 78 million jobs that are vulnerable to be automated (IMF Report. 2021). And not enough non-routine. cognitive jobs being created (62mill) to fill this unemployment. gap(IMF Report. 2021). And lets take today‚Äôs discussion to talk about how this unfair wealth battlefield can be given its justice. It is currently important to study how this divide is ‚Äúcreated strongly due to technology‚Äôs impact on employability‚Äù.at this point time - and prepare ourselves for an ambiguous future\n\n1. Job Displacement due to Automation\nAutomation has pierced through not just manufacturing sectors. but a vast array of industries. radically transforming the employment landscape. Far from being limited to routine and repetitive tasks. modern technological tools are expanding into spaces we once believed were uniquely human: content generation. graphic design. music composition. and even video editing.\n\nData Snapshot: Forecasts warn that a staggering 800 million workers worldwide could find their roles obsolete by 2030 due to automation. Furthermore. an alarming statistic states that 60% of all occupations have at least 30% of tasks that can be automated. signifying the breadth of the potential impact.\n2. The Daunting Skills Gap\nThe velocity at which technology is advancing presents a conundrum. On one end. there's a surge in tech-centric roles. while on the other. there's a glaring skills deficit. This gap is even more pronounced among certain demographics: the elderly. individuals in rural settings. those encumbered by responsibilities. people with disabilities. immigrants. refugees. and professionals in non-tech domains.\n\nData Snapshot: The World Bank's 2020 report on the digital economy illuminated the magnitude of this disparity. noting that a mere 1% of Africa's workforce possesses ICT skills. Moreover. Deloitte's findings underline this crisis. with 64% of employees believing their organizations are unprepared to bridge this skills chasm. Adding fuel to the fire. only 17% of institutions are confident about having a future-ready workforce.\n3. Escalating Income Inequality\nThe technological boom has inadvertently created a rift between high-skilled tech aficionados and low-skilled workers. As the former group reaps the benefits of a tech-driven economy. the latter. especially those susceptible to automation. grapples with stagnating or diminishing wages.\n\nData Snapshot: As per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. the wage gap between those armed with a college degree and those with just a high school education has been expanding. The United Nations' ITU highlights another facet. pointing out that a lack of access to digital tools and the internet exacerbates income inequality.\n4. Concentration of Wealth: The Tech Elites\nIt's undeniable that the tech era has given birth to a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals. This isn't just about riches but also the power and influence that come with such immense wealth. from influencing political decisions to shaping economic policies.\n\nData Snapshot: 2021 data reveals that the collective wealth of global billionaires skyrocketed to over $10 trillion. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. the ten wealthiest individuals added a colossal $450 billion to their coffers. To put this disparity into perspective. the top 1% of the global populace controls more than 44% of the world's wealth.\n5. Gig Economy: Freedom or Feudalism?\nThe gig economy. bolstered by technology. promises flexibility and autonomy. Yet. it's essential to ponder whether it's a genuine avenue for empowerment or merely a modern form of feudalism. where workers. despite being 'connected'. remain isolated and vulnerable.\n\nData Snapshot: The gig ecosystem has witnessed explosive growth. with 36% of the U.S. workforce engaged in gig roles. cumulatively contributing to a market valued at $204 billion.\nIn synthesizing these insights. the digital age emerges as a paradox. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. it simultaneously casts shadows of inequality and uncertainty. As we navigate this era. it's paramount that stakeholders ‚Äì from governments to corporations to educators ‚Äì work in tandem to ensure that the digital future is inclusive. equitable. and just.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nPRODUCT\nEscaping your mind. into unimaginable futures\nUnderstanding basics of futurecasting and learning from examples of people who did it wrong.\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n4 OCT 2023 ‚Ä¢ 3 MIN READ\n\nSwitching streams midway\nI did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software.

This blog would be the story and the specifics of what a lot of people have asked me over the years. about how I made the switch and some things that you can use too. if you're interested in the same\n\nI'll keep a major part of this blog very generic to the topic \"switching streams\" in general and then I'll add a section. at the end. about things I did.\n\nContinuous learning is the name of the game\nToday. learning anything is completely possible. at any given point. if you're willing to put in the work.\n\nA lot of times we're under the notion that only a few people can learn a skillset based on the course they're \"officially\" enrolled in or some background experience they've had. I don't believe so. I think. that in this all-knowing YouTube and ever-improving-chatGPT era - anyone can learn anything from the Internet - for free. at their pace and convenience and from tonnes of world leading tutors.\n\nHere are some pointers that might help you:\n\nThere is no magical playbook - to learn anything. it takes a lot of time and persistent effort of finding the right material for yourself and creating a roadmap for improving in the skill. So it's fine if you're not having a clear path to start with. There are a couple of channels that can give a clear path. but I think. that just starting from a Google or YouTube search about the topic name is a good place to start.\nTaking notes really helps - Even if it's rough screenshots. scribbling random thoughts while learning or just copy-paste's of youtube videos - it works. I'm currently exploring YouTube video summarizer plugin in ChatGPT for this purpose. What's even better is revising and refining notes - for smarter reference later. It's like creating a power pellet from your learnings that you can consume at any point in the future to catch up on the skill super-fast. I used Notion for organizing whatever I've learnt into easily reference-able notes.\nMotivation is 2/3rds of the game - Dedicate a fixed time slot for learning and keep struggling to make the most of it. Have very little ego. Initially you might suck - that's cool. But after breaking your head for about 1-2months. you'll not even realize but you'll naturally start seeing patterns and connections. That's the next level.\nYou shouldn't be afraid to suck at something new and give up if you struggle across even when understanding a paragraph of a new topic. Hell. when I was learning programming. it took me about 12hours to fully grasp and implement a 5 min youtube video about animation. But then. relentlessly pursuing on and on and on. I was able to condense 12 hr worth learnings into 5mins of revision through my notes. It's going to be hard. but if you just stick with it. it's going to be worth it.\n\nThe world is project-driven\nWe live in a fast paced world where most teams just look for how much value an individual can add to their team. If you've independently taught yourself and built impactful projects. no one really cares about your background coming from.\n\nThis can be harvested well to your benefit if you want to even your odds with those. who are already in the stream you like. Just build projects that rival with them. And these days YouTube has walkthroughs of any project across any stream for free - it's just so good.\n\nHere are some key pointers to help you in this leg:\n\nProjects are strong applications of learning - Project can mean anything - a tiny robot. a sketch. a basic app. a research paper commentary. a spreadsheet. ¬†a 5sec musical composition. a youtube video - anything. Point is - you're supposed ¬†to have employed your learnings and you're supposed to have worked super hard. It will help grasp the reason of each thing you thought was dumb but you read anyways and help translate it into moving parts of something very impactful\nStart by copying other people's work - A good place to start is searching for existing projects on the internet and interpreting and recreating their work. Painters. musicians. writers. chefs - do it all the time while practicing - just patiently learning from the experience of others. This would help avoid pitfalls and learn best practices from your teachers. Again - don't just blind copy as they do. Refer - understand - try to recreate - fail - go back to refer- then understand - then try to recreate and so on.\nAdd your own flavor to each project - Employ a personalized touch to your project so that its unique. In the early days. I liked reading so when I came to programming projects - I would just add quotes of my favourite personalities in them as my touch. Now for you. it can be anything you like. but once you do this. you just differentiate extremely well from every other person who's just blind-copying and give a polished overall outcome\nTie the project to your ego - I get why this might be a double-edged sword but hear me out. Once you set a benchmark for the finished expectations from a project - tie it to the fact that it's something the world will see as a finished project from \"you\" and hence it can't fall below a certain quality threshold. For me. it used to motivate me to always push the project to completion and have it satisfy some baseline criteria.\nLearn and grow with stakeholders - Some projects. you might not do alone and hence the coolest thing would be to learn from your collaborators and ensure they have a good experience working with you. Believe it or not. people and team skills are still one of the most important virtues for any team. Have fixed meetings. track your progress. hit your metrics and note down and share - what each of you learnt from the project. Projects offer collaborative opportunities and hence you can learn much beyond the books and the internet - you learn from people and in a lot of ways - what you learn will surprise you.\nThe more you passionately employ your learnings into real-time applications the more strongly your education will stick to you. ¬†\n\nHow to sell yourself\nThe next step after building projects is to share your work with the world and capitalize on it.\n\nFew pointers on this are:\n\nHave an online gallery - Every time you learn something. it would really help if you could maintain a online browsable gallery of your work. Be it your GitHub page or Dribbble gallery or LinkedIn profile or blog page. Just everytime you wrap up learning something. create an online snapshot for the world to view your thinking. approach. knowledge depth etc.\nLook for interesting people and DM them: I used LinkedIn. Each time I found a person with interesting work - I would DM (Direct Message) them on LinkedIn and if possible. even get on a call to understand how they thought and learn from them. Seriously. it helps so much to get other people's feedback on your approach. Beyond this. there are obviously interesting conferences that you can just boldly sign up for. attend and be the newbie who talks and learns from everyone.\nConfidence is free: In the early days in this new stream. you'll often feel imposter syndrome and underconfident - so start pretending otherwise. With time. it will grow into something more solid and with the knowledge and experience piling on. it would just compound. Confidence also helps express passion and clarity for the subject matter so the more you are confident about your projects and subject matter. the more people would value your work\nI guess that about sums it up - in a nutshell - randomly search for ways to learn. iteratively keep sucking till you get better. build toy projects that make you happy and confidently talk about them on platforms. Rest. I'm 100% sure. the journey you take will help you figure out.\n\nMy story\nAlright. now I'll be more specific about my story and things I did. I grew up in a middle-class family in India. thinking that a good college. a good job would be the only salvation. So naturally. once I got into the 4 year Civil Engineering program at IIT Madras. I thought that this would limit me from pursuing anything lateral. But in this internet-learning driven age. that's hardly the case.\n\nTo find what I liked - for a year. I dated a lot of career options - photo and videography. standup comedy. automotive engineering. consulting. designing. architecture and many countless others - mainly through hanging with different clubs of students in my college. ¬†Once I stumbled upon \"software startups\" I've just felt an irresistable pull to it. that stands to this day. Obviously there are a lot of days where I've doubted it too. but if it's your calling. some part of you always knows and gets attracted to it.\n\nNow the specifics okay. I'll make it pointwise and list specific instructors and courses so that you can maybe check them out:\n\nDisclaimer: You don't have to do it like me. Just read my opinion and do it the way most apt to you :)\nI learnt the basics of programming in C Language from the hard copy book - How to C. by Prashant Kanetkar. It took me 4 months with my other college work helps understand the foundation of how a piece of code is designed. written. interpreted and executed.\nNext 4 months. I learnt web development (HTML. CSS. JS) from DevEd. WebDevSimplified and Brad Traversy. I also use Laith Harb for time to time learning of new skills. Also. I used to build a lot of toy projects that these youtubers would post walkthrough videos of - this udemy course of 20 projects with Javascript is pretty sweet - link. Also learnt Git during this time\nI used to also pursue first 2 hrs of any random long 7-8hr videos from FreeCodeCamp's youtube channel - anything from Data Structures and Algorithms to CyberSecurity to even color designing. I even did a bit of digital illustrations from from Gary Simon.\nAfter this. I was consuming content and courses very fast. In the next 2months I learnt NodeJS. ¬†React and TypeScript. GraphQL. Docker and other misc topics. These are the most common industry technologies in use these days.\nI even learnt basics of Data Structures and Algorithms and some Systems Designing from Algoexpert. A good place to start learning the basics of literally anything programming or computer related is Fireship - who does amazing 100second video intros of a tech.\nFrom time to time. I've flirted with Machine Learning and AI courses from DeepLearning. ZeroToMastery and random blogs and projects and stuff. But these 2 sources are very strong for it\nNext up. I was having trouble deploying apps and understanding large scale software so I studied systems designing from Gaurav Sen since it helps fall in love with the strength of computing. I also completed certifications from AWS. Google and Microsoft with the help of Stephane Mareek's amazing content\nIn fact. I feel that Stephane Mareek's course on Cloud Computing is a must-do for any software engineer to appreciate the beauty of internet and all cloud services that become the strong backbone of it. Just do this course. trust me.\nYeah and after that I got into generalist mindset and I was brushing up on everything from Figma for designing to Flutter for app development and was tinkering with over 10 frameworks and DevOps products at any given point for building great software.\nTo start getting more professional experience. I used to always offer myself up as a cheap developer to startups. I remember cold reaching out to 200+ engineers and founders (not HR since they have less of a say in hiring than actual engineers who lead teams) on linkedin over 4 months before I landed my 1st internship.\nIn startups. ¬†I could learn a lot everything about businesses - in the high-growth-vacuum environment that startups offer. Plus I made some money. re-invested that back in random tech-courses and business-books that I used to pick like a kid at a candy store and kept building and building a 2nd brain of mine in Notion.\nI kept up my spirit and did create projects entirely from scratch on my own right after the 1st 6months even though they felt shitty and didn't work as well. Some. I couldn't even afford to keep running cause I would have to enter credit card details and I didn't have one back then. So I created YouTube videos or blog posts and shared the code as I sunsetted each project deployment. You can find a log here - link. Point is just keep trying honestly.\n\n2nd brain in Notion\nYeah and after that I tried to run my own software startup. made some money and I failed to run it long term (here's the story of it - link).\n\nI balanced all this work with college. Fun thing is. once you do projects. everyone wants to give you a shot - be it professors looking for programmers or startups looking for part-time developers.\n\nA lot of times. people ask me how I managed my time or remembered so much. I do not. I just used \"Google Calendar\" and practiced using a lot of tools to keep reminding me to meet my goals and do my things. Every night before I go to sleep. I plan my next day's calendar for 10mins to be a good student. programmer. student-club head. brother. son. friend or any role that I feel is important dedicating my time to. Recently I even started to take Mondays to plan 3 to 4 most important things I wanted to achieve in each sphere of life in that week - like learning to cook. or reading a book. finishing an online course. deploying a project. teaching my mom about tech or even learning to play squash or salsa dancing with my friend - I tracked it all so I knew if I was missing out on time for any of my commitments.\n\nMy academics did take a hit no doubt - but I knew that I wasn't giving enough time to it and why I wasn't so it was cool.\nRecently. I ended up applying to Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nIt took me a lot of research and advice - and I made this document to put down my thoughts. goals and opportunities - link. This was the single most important thing I did before choosing what I wanted to do next. I showed this doc to my seniors. people I knew and respected. family and friends and finally collated their advice into a decision.\n\nFor applying. here's all I did:\n\nI gave the GRE test (325/340 with 4.5 in essay writing) and TOEFL test (111/120) though I didn't think GRE would have much weightage now. People say you gotta take paid courses and prep for 5 months and I don't believe it. Just mark your calendar. Go through this free material I aggregated in 2022. for GRE and TOEFL and you'll be able to get it done sooner.\nNext. I talked a lot about my projects in my SoP. I wrote about majorly. creating impact through startups and software. you can give it a read - link.\nMy CGPA in academia was 8.01 out of 10 in my undergraduate college. I willingly didn't study as much in class or in pen-paper exams. But I pursued projects passionately and that's where I caught up on.\nFor Letters of Recommendation - 1. I got from the CEO/Founder 1st startup I worked with for 9months. Next. a letter from a Computer Science professor in my undergraduate whom I helped for free as a DevOps engineer on his logistics project. back in my 3rd year. I got my 3rd reco letter from my favourite Computer Science professor who had taught me 1 course (and that too I didn't score that well XD). but he just looked at my profile and work and decided to give me a shot. And yeah. that's where sometimes just asking gets you to. I just wrote him (and other profs too) an email and he called me for a 20min meeting and decided to help me out\nI guess with all of that. I'm now headed for a Masters in Software Management to Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I've messed up a lot. Have done a tonne of random things and kept exploring. Some of it worked. Most didn't.\n\n\nIn the end. I just have 1 advice - read a lot of opinions to expand your world view but at the end. internalize all that info with with what feels right in your heart. and trust me. just fuck it and do it.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nImpact of Technology on Employability and Wealth\nUnderstanding what the future of work and employment could be like. given advancements in tech\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n2 SEP 2023 ‚Ä¢ 3 MIN READ\n\nCOLLEGE\nTechnology and India - 1970 vs 2023\nA very small mental snapshot of what my undegrad college (IIT Madras) felt like when I graduated\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n9 AUG 2023 ‚Ä¢ 7 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

What ensued were views about IIT Madras and India in the 1970s. This is a fun anecdotal blog that tells 2 stories from different ages and how. from studying what happens in India's colleges. we can study the broader outlook of technological progress in the nation\n\n1970s\nFollowing is the message from an alum - Sudhir Krishna who passed out in the 1970s\n\nB.Tech was a 5-year program. ¬† Half of the first year was spent toiling in the workshops wearing khaki uniform. ¬† The curriculum was course-heavy: ¬†Usually had 7 courses per semester. and reached 8 courses in the 7th semester (4th year). ¬† Continuous contact hours from 8 AM to 4:15 PM (with lunch from noon to 1:15 PM). ¬† ¬†Not much free time for creative projects except in the final (10th) semester. ¬† ¬†The German collaboration was still evident and some German faculty were still around. ¬† The campus population (students. faculty. administrators. staff) was much smaller than it is now. ¬† ¬†We all had single rooms in hostels. ¬† The annual cultural festival Mardi Gras was started and has now become Saarang (right?). ¬† ¬†Students were multi-talented -- academics. music. chess. bridge. quiz. drama/ acting. mimicry. sports. literary activities. etc. ¬† I myself was captain of the institute chess team. member of the institute tennis team for a couple of years. won the institute debate contest one year. represented IIT-M at the cultural festivals of other IITs. and became Under Officer in NCC Air Wing.\nAlso. back in the 1970s. India was still a poor country with a socialist economy. ¬† The country's global image was associated with poverty. backwardness. ¬† Only some American universities and companies were aware of the IIT brand. most notably Harvard Business School (where I got my MBA) and management consulting firms like McKinsey. ¬† Even back then. HBS admissions officers said they viewed IIT B.Techs the same way they did MIT and Caltech undergrads. ¬† But they made fun of Indian typewriters that were used for completing the application forms\n\nI received an invitation from McKinsey for an interview that began with \"Because of your Indian Institute of Technology background.......\"\n\n2023\nI recently graduated from IIT Madras. The hostel sector is quite lush with trees starting to form canopies above. The monkeys are not only more in number now. but more in daring as well. They're smart. bold and know how to work the system to get what they want.\n\nThe academics are strong and flexible with students having the option to pursue whatever they want. irrespective of their BTech department. A lot of application and project based courses have sprung up where we do assignments and mini-projects as opposed to just written exams.\n\nStudents are a lot in number now and it's fun to see everyone put honest hard work in their passions - right from technology and sciences to art. music. comedy and gaming. You find people of all interests and talents. The labs and workshop are still hands-on. though only about 40% of what it used to be in the 1970s. The departments have also developing into independent schools of specialization on their own with tonnes of activities. projects. lectures. events. yearly festival and more. In fact. the new department called \"Engineering Design\" - (near Velachery Gate) offers a lot of product designing and entrepreneurship encouragement in both- ¬†hardware and software. There's the department for management studies. humanities and flexibility of leveraging online platforms like NPTEL (https://nptel.ac.in) apart from attending in-person classes.\n\nHere's my favourite part - the student-run project lab - Center for Innovation at IIT Madras - has over 20 teams and a 2 storey cool building. each one tinkering in topics all the way from AI. robotics. app development and racecar engg to energy efficiency. rocketry. product designing and rural tech (check this for more - https://blog.techsoc.iitm.ac.in/tech-iitm-in-5-mins/). So I'd say recovering from the pandemic. projects are at a powerful high\n\nHostel culture also seems to be re-igniting. guess a lot of it got hit during the pandemic years but teams like Schroeter. LitSoc and TechSoc are putting the fire back in. Athletics is strong and we won 1st in Men's championship and 4th overall in Inter IIT Sports Meet. We bagged 6 medals in Inter IIT Tech Meet (Golds in AI and entrepreneurship) and came 3rd in Inter IIT Cultural Meet.\n\nIn a nutshell. IITM has become the perfect home for pursuing anything passionately\nSpeaking of animals - monkeys are ruling the hostels so much so that we get a complaint email about monkey assault every week or 2. They're bold and smart and compete for food. ¬†The deer and blackbuck population is also fair and we do hangout with them in lawns sometimes. Dogs were actually moved out of the campus in 2019 since they used to hunt deer. There's a species of red ants we see all the time and snakes are barely spotted once or twice a year during rains. if anytime. Funnily. scorpions are seen near admin buildings and hostels sometimes\nWorkshops are lighter and we have much more time for creative activities. If you can think of it. there's a club for it working passionately.\nOn nearby places - Right now. Taramani is still go to for tea. snacks and cigarettes and food delivery orders. There are 2 cycle repair shops in insti. We get great breeze. most likely attributed to the greenery since the construction has blocked out the sea breeze. Student's these days hang out mostly around a huge mall outside Velachery. the food shops along the 100 ft. Road outside Taramani. Elliot's and Marina beach. Chetpet Eco-park this place called \"Hidden Lake\". Tada waterfalls in Andhra. and Westin bar (if you have money :)). But insti itself is I think the most happening place for so many technical. sport and cultural things that folks barely step out.\nOn innovation- Self-innovation and Entrepreneurship is being spearheaded by the new Director - Professor Kamakoti. In collaboration with Indian government. Professor Prabhu Rajagopal and his team - is doing several things to help students build products and eventually. companies. In fact. a couple of companies like Ather. HyperVerge. Solinas Integrity - born right inside IIT Madras - are making waves. Most recently Clueso got funded by YCombinator in 2023 and it furthered more students to do this.\nOn inside insti ¬†- The Dhaba outside Saras is now a full-fledged restaurant with all kinds of Indian food. juices and snacks. It's currently managed by the caterer - Zaitoon - but the tender is open for bids every 3 years. We had to recently monkey proof it due to the stealing incidents XD. The first floor of this is converted into a colorful place with a large television screen for student clubs to sit and ideate. Mummy Daddy Andhra mess outside Taramani is our go-to place for Biryani. Our tuition fees. without scholarship. are now INR 1.00.000 and hostel fees is INR 26.000 for each semester. The hostel bonding. as Srikanth said. is more shifted to clubs and messes are detached from hostels. This has helped in knowing a lot more breadth-wise bonding.\nA lot of construction is going on now. There are 2 new Academic complexes. And a new sports complex is being made near the tennis courts\nIIT Madras is a lot more creative. entrepreneurial. ¬† Its population is much larger. ¬† The post-graduate programs have grown a lot. ¬† Admissions quotas based on caste and gender have made the student population more diverse. ¬†(We had very few women during our time.) ¬† The IIT brand name is now world renowned. but still based largely on its undergrad B.Tech program and not yet for post-graduate and research programs. ¬† IIT alumni have distinguished themselves in America and reached the highest levels in industry and academia.\n\nAlso. India as a country has changed. ¬† It is capitalistic. entrepreneurial and technologically advanced. ¬† The country's nominal GDP is world #5 and projected to become world #3 by 2028. ¬† PM Modi. in my opinion. is a superstar on the global stage and gets royal treatment wherever he goes. ¬† Geopolitically. India is viewed as a counterweight to China. ¬† This is shaping up to be a China-India century and will be very evident by 2050. ¬† As for IITs. there are 23 of them now. ¬† While the 5 original IITs still rank at the top in India. some of the newer IITs are establishing niches of excellence for themselves. ¬†IIT Madras is ranked at the top.\n\nAttaching a couple videos and pictures of campus here for your reference\nCheckout these videos:\n\nAerial view IITM - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m3IlAmSiFs\nCampus tour - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUfsG5xQnuU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFruit juices are still cheap. Canteens still open till 3am. Sunlight still glitters through trees. Students still mess around but have that drive to innovate and lastly - friendships are still stupid and meaningful.\n\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN COLLEGE\nOle ole Alakananda\n27 Jul 2023 ‚Äì 5 min read\n\n1 post ‚Üí\n\nSwitching streams midway\nI did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering and pursued my career in software.

Madras. Here's 8 lessons I learnt from my 8 semesters and stories of how I learnt them so this is not some lame vanity post.\n\n\nJuly 2019. entering college\nSemester 1: It's a big world and trying everything. even lying outside your comfort zone is free. Be open to talk to everyone and make tonnes of friends. Semester 8 will teach you why its important. I picked up this lesson while borrowing 300 from a hostel guard to pay for pizza at 3am. attempting failed jokes at open mics and also while countlessly sitting in club orientations. It's always a good time to suck at new things :)\n\n\nSemester 2: It's college. you can sign up for tonnes of things and asking anyone for help is free - people genuinely want to help. I learnt this while being disciplined and trained by the legends of the Raftar Formula Racing team as we championed 3 national trophies against all odds. Discipline and accountability take passion and convert it into wonders.\n\n\nSemester 3: Just build projects that teach you skills you find cool. Persistence and hard work will help you trump all odds to be good at what you love. Maintaining motivation is 2/3rds of the game. Sitting in a COVID ridden world. using my neighbour (Jay Bafna's) WiFi to learn software development and making dumb projects like todo apps taught me that just inching a little closer to ambition. Preferably start an online presence of you that tracks your work well - write about your work and share\n\n\nSemester 4: At this point. I'd say start taking bets on yourself and bold risks is the best - you're young - what's the worst that could happen? I learnt this core lesson when I decided to leave home and work at Farmako (YC S20) with a different set of legends. Having very little resources and pure hunger to survive and succeed over 9 months taught me a lot about the brilliant impact a small determined set of people can have on the world. Be stupid. take more bets. You're young and smart - you'll figure it out\n\n\nSemester 5: You'll see a world of people who seem to have figured it out and gotten it right. But most of us are just winging it. I'd say at this point. just being real with a couple friends and still believing and taking bets is the hard path. I personally learnt it through shit tonne of mistakes. self-doubt and pain and tears that 2 things in life mattered - I was working on something I cared about. and I was around people I loved. I follow this principle to date. Not caring about a lot of external stimuli is a superpower you can acquire by just self-assessing.\n\n\nSemester 6: You're growing now. Tension is building up and you're probably expected to have figured out life. You don't. In fact it's a good thing if you've failed over 3-4 times by now - it means you're trying and getting back-up enough. Having a vague idea of how you want to spend time - that's something I'd recommend having. A good idea here is take up something. and no matter how much it pains. see it through completion. Working with Logistics Lab. IIT Madras and Coursepanel taught me that enduring and reaching the finish line is way more important than procastinating for perfection or giving up midway. That's a major differentiating factor too.\n\n\nSemester 7: You're probably multi-tasking at this point. Become boring. routine-driven - use a calendar and documentation tools to string multiple tracks together. Write a lot - it helps unclutter the mind and think clearly. I know it's boring but having control over how your time. energy and money flows by writing stuff down goes a long way. It helps aim long for a year and piece it down to what you and your team need to do today. I learnt this while helping Institute Technical Society (TechSoc). IIT Madras frame its vision from to 1700+ participants. 14 events and countless projects. I learnt that small tasks with directed effort moves mountains.\n\n\nSemester 8: It's your turn to give back now. Now your old friendships will blossom and it's time to be ready for new ones. Be there as a mentor your junior self would have appreciated. Preferably take up a position of responsibility that's undervalued and difficult and lead a team through and through. no matter what it costs. I think the Inter IIT Technical Meet at Indian Institute of Technology. Kanpur where we went from stranded on a railway station to nailing medals in Kanpur (2000 miles away) in under 40 hours.\n\n\nMost lessons are not my own and have been taught to me by amazing amazing mentors. friends. family members and I'm undeniably grateful to.\n\nThis blog won't solve your problems - hell. mine also took a fuckload of meanderings before I got to understand them. Think of it as more like - not repeating my fuckups. College is a mix of confusion and opportunities. wins and losses - in a short time frame so screw everything and feel free to ping me anytime if you're going through something and need a ear. Listen to all this - but the best part is - don't do it like me. do it like you. üòâ\n\nOle ole Alakananda !\n\n\nFeatured videos for funzz\nForced guitar jamming on grad nite\nOle ole alakananda - is your hostel this cool?\n3 idiots. 1 car and some sunshine - roadtrip\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN COLLEGE\nTechnology and India - 1970 vs 2023\n9 Aug 2023 ‚Äì 7 min read\n\n1 post ‚Üí\n\nCOLLEGE\nTechnology and India - 1970 vs 2023\nA very small mental snapshot of what my undegrad college (IIT Madras) felt like when I graduated\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n9 AUG 2023 ‚Ä¢ 7 MIN READ\n\nMACHINE LEARNING\nThe One-size-fits-all ML-project template?\nA problem. framework. budget. library. language agnostic approach to ML\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n7 JUL 2023 ‚Ä¢ 8 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

In this blog. we will provide a comprehensive guideline to help you navigate your machine learning projects smoothly.\n\nLet's first sing a song to kickoff this blog\n\n\nIn a nutshell. what are we gonna talk about\nIt's 6 basic steps - no matter what ML project or framework you're working with - it's usually always 6 steps. In this section. I'll be covering them in short but moving ahead. I'll share resources for templates and tricks for each step. Let's hear em out!\n\n\nSteps of ML\n0. Become One with the Data\nThe initial step to every machine learning project is understanding your data. Make sure you visualise your data in as many ways as possible to gain insights. This could include checking the distribution of your data. identifying potential outliers. and understanding the relationship between different variables.\n\n1. Preprocessing Your Data\nRaw data is rarely ready for a machine learning model. You must preprocess your data to optimize it for learning. This may include tasks such as cleaning. normalization. and standardization of values.\n\nWhen dealing with large datasets. it's common to divide them into smaller subsets known as \"batches\". A batch is a subset of the dataset that the model looks at while training. This is done because processing large datasets might not fit into the memory of your processor. and trying to learn patterns in the entire dataset in one go could result in the model not learning very well.\n\n2. Creating a Model\nStarting with a baseline model is an excellent approach for any machine learning project. A \"baseline\" is a relatively simple. existing model that you set up when you start your machine learning experiment. As you progress. you try to beat the baseline by experimenting with more complex or suitable models. Here you can explore the State of the Art algorithms to identify suitable models for your project.\n\n3. Compiling and Fitting the Model\nOnce you have decided on your model. the next step is to compile it. This step involves defining the loss function. optimizer. and the evaluation metrics. After compiling. fit your model to the training data. allowing it to learn the underlying patterns.\n\n4. Evaluating the Model\nAfter your model has been fitted. it's time to evaluate its performance. Use your test data to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. This will give you an idea about how your model might perform in real-world scenarios.\n\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning\nIn order to improve the model's performance. you will need to tune its hyperparameters. This process involves experimenting with various values for different hyperparameters to find the combination that provides the best performance.\n\nRemember. overfitting and underfitting are two crucial aspects to consider during hyperparameter tuning. If your model is overfitting. consider using techniques such as data augmentation. regularization layers. or increasing your data. These techniques can help your model generalize better.\n\n6. Iterate Until Satisfied\nThe above steps are not a one-time process. You might need to iterate over them several times before you achieve a satisfactory model performance. Keep experimenting until you have optimized your model.\n\n8. Explore Advanced Techniques for Improvement\nOnce you have beaten your baseline. you can start exploring advanced techniques to further improve the performance of your model. This could involve adding more layers to your model. training for a longer period. finding an ideal learning rate. using more data. or using transfer learning.\n\nDeep Diving into templates and tricks\nProcessing the Data\nThe first step in any machine learning project is to preprocess your data. Data augmentation and data shuffling are critical aspects of this stage.\n\nData augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of your data by making slight modifications to it. thereby enabling your model to learn more generalizable patterns. This technique is especially effective in image data. where actions such as rotating. flipping. and cropping an image can help diversify your dataset.\n\nShuffling data is essential to disrupt any inherent order that may exist in your dataset. such as all examples of a particular class clustered together. Shuffling ensures your model is exposed to various classes during training and avoids overfitting to a specific class. If your model displays erratic accuracy while training. consider shuffling your data.\n\nWhen processing your data. you may consider various scaling techniques to standardize your dataset. For example:\n\nStandardScaler can give each feature zero-mean and unit standard deviation.\nMinMaxScaler provides a non-distorting. light-touch transformation.\nRobustScaler is useful for reducing the influence of outliers.\nNormalizer provides row-based normalization. using l1 or l2 normalization.\nRefer to this cheat sheet for more information on preprocessing techniques.\n\nStart with a Baseline\nStarting with a simple baseline model allows us to have a reference point for comparing the improvements gained from enhancing our model. Fitting a baseline model typically involves three steps:\n\nCreating a model: Define the input. output. and hidden layers of a deep learning model.\nCompiling a model: Define the loss function. optimizer. and evaluation metrics for the model.\nFitting a model: Train the model to find patterns between features and labels.\nBaseline models can be created using various libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. based on your project's requirements.\n\nPyTorch\ntorch.manual_seed(42)\n\n# Set the number of epochs (how many times the model will pass over the training data)\nepochs = 100\n\n# Create empty loss lists to track values\ntrain_loss_values = []\ntest_loss_values = []\nepoch_count = []\n\n# Put data on the available device\n# Without this. error will happen (not all model/data on device)\nX_train = X_train.to(device)\nX_test = X_test.to(device)\ny_train = y_train.to(device)\ny_test = y_test.to(device)\n\nfor epoch in range(epochs):\n    ### Training\n\n    # Put model in training mode (this is the default state of a model)\n    model_0.train()\n\n    # 1.

Plots comparing ground truth labels and model predictions can provide insights into how well our model is performing. For regression problems. evaluation metrics like Mean Average Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) can be used to quantify the average errors of our model's predictions.\n\nTracking Experiments\nVisualizing our model's predictions\nApart from that. a good way to proceed is visualize. visualize. visualize!\n\nIt's a good idea to visualize\n\nThe data - What data are we working with? What does the data look like?\nThe model itself - what does our model look like\nThe training of a model - How does a model perform as it is learning?\nThe predictions of the model -How do the predictions match up against the ground truth (the original labels)\nTo visualize our model's predictions. it's a good idea to plot them against ground truth values\n\ndef plot_predictions(train_data=X_train. \n                     train_labels=y_train. \n                     test_data=X_test. \n                     test_labels=y_test. \n                     predictions=None):\n  \"\"\"\n  Plots training data. test data and compares predictions.\n  \"\"\"\n  plt.figure(figsize=(10. 7))\n\n  # Plot training data in blue\n  plt.scatter(train_data. train_labels. c=\"b\". s=4. label=\"Training data\")\n  \n  # Plot test data in green\n  plt.scatter(test_data. test_labels. c=\"g\". s=4. label=\"Testing data\")\n\n  if predictions is not None:\n    # Plot the predictions in red (predictions were made on the test data)\n    plt.scatter(test_data. predictions. c=\"r\". s=4. label=\"Predictions\")\n\n  # Show the legend\n  plt.legend(prop={\"size\": 14});\nTo efficiently compare the performance of different models and configurations. it is essential to track the results of your experiments. Tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases can be useful in managing and visualizing your experiments' results.\n\nImproving Our Model\nBuild the model -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> fit it -> evaluate it -> tweak it -> ....\n\nImproving model accuracy is an iterative process that involves revisiting the model creation. compilation. and training stages.\n\nDuring the model creation stage. you might add more layers. increase the number of hidden units in each layer. or change the activation function. In the compilation stage. changing the optimization function or adjusting the learning rate could improve model performance. The training stage could involve training the model for more epochs or using a larger dataset.\n\nThis process of modifying various parameters to enhance the model's performance is known as \"hyperparameter tuning\".\n\nApproaches to improve accuracy\n\nGet more data -> Get a larger dataset that we can train our model on\nHyperparameter tuning -> Use more hidden layers or increase number of neurons in each hidden layer\nTrain for longer -> Give your model more of a chance to find patterns in the dataset\nSave a Model\nSaving a model is essential for using it outside the training environment. like in a web or mobile application. Models can be stored in the SavedModel Format or the HDF5 Format in TensorFlow. depending on whether you plan to tweak and train the model further in TensorFlow or outside TensorFlow. In PyTorch. the recommended method is saving and loading the model's state_dict().\n\nPyTorch code\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# 1. Create models directory \nMODEL_PATH = Path(\"models\")\nMODEL_PATH.mkdir(parents=True. exist_ok=True)\n\n# 2. Create model save path \nMODEL_NAME = \"01_pytorch_workflow_model_0.pth\"\nMODEL_SAVE_PATH = MODEL_PATH / MODEL_NAME\n\n# 3. Save the model state dict \nprint(f\"Saving model to: {MODEL_SAVE_PATH}\")\ntorch.save(obj=model_0.state_dict(). # only saving the state_dict() only saves the models learned parameters\n           f=MODEL_SAVE_PATH)\nRun on GPU\nRunning your model on a GPU can significantly speed up training. You can check if your model is set to run on a GPU using the model.parameters().device function and set it to GPU using the model.to(device) function. where device is set to \"cuda\" for GPU or \"cpu\" for the Central Processing Unit.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion. understanding these steps will assist you in structuring your ML projects effectively. Remember. machine learning is an iterative process. and it's okay to go back and forth between steps to improve your model's performance.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN MACHINE LEARNING\nHuggingSage\n22 Oct 2023 ‚Äì 8 min read\n\nWhat's a tensor & why is it in ML?\n18 Nov 2022 ‚Äì 10 min read\n\nUsing ML Algorithms\n19 May 2022 ‚Äì 8 min read\n\nSee all 3 posts ‚Üí\n\nCOLLEGE\nOle ole Alakananda\nGoing from failed standup comedy and jugaading expenses to growing up and finding passion\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n27 JUL 2023 ‚Ä¢ 5 MIN READ\n\nSERVERLESS\nGetting started with Serverless.

AWS Lambda and SAM on MacOS\nDiscover how to leverage the AWS Serverless Framework and AWS SAM for efficient. cost-effective cloud computing. This guide walks through the setup on MacOS. from installing necessary tools to deploying and managing serverless applications.\n\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\nRead more posts by this author.\n\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n5 JUL 2023 ‚Ä¢ 3 MIN READ\n\nIntroduction\nAs we progress in the age of digital transformation. organizations are migrating more and more of their operations to the cloud. The Serverless Framework. an open-source project that provides a convenient way to build and deploy applications on AWS Lambda. is a perfect tool for this migration. It eliminates the need for server management. which helps to reduce costs significantly. But what is AWS Serverless. and how does it function? In this blog. we'll go over the essentials of the Serverless framework and how to set it up on a MacOS machine. We'll also introduce the AWS SAM and its uses.\n\nWhat is AWS Serverless Framework and How is it Helpful?\nThe Serverless framework is a cloud-computing model in which the cloud provider automatically manages the provisioning and allocation of servers. This model allows developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers or runtimes. either in the cloud or on-premises. With AWS Lambda. you only pay for the compute time that you consume. This eliminates the need to provision and manage servers. making serverless a cost-effective solution for many applications.\n\nInstalling Node.js and Python on Your MacOS Machine\nBefore we start with the Serverless framework. we need to have Node.js and Python installed on our machine.\n\nTo install Node.js. we use the package manager npm. Open Terminal and type the following command:\n\nbrew install node\n\nFor Python. MacOS already comes with a pre-installed version. However. it's a good idea to install a separate instance using Homebrew:\n\nbrew install python\n\nTo verify successful installation. type node -v for Node.js and python --version for Python. You should see the respective version numbers displayed.\n\nSetting Up AWS and Serverless CLI on MacOS Machine\nAfter installing Node.js and Python. it's time to install the Serverless CLI. You can install it globally with npm:\n\nnpm i -g serverless\n\nUpon installation. verify the version using serverless -v command.\n\nTo deploy your functions on AWS. you need to set up AWS credentials. Run the following command. replacing KEY and SECRET with your actual AWS credentials:\n\nserverless config credentials --provider aws --key KEY --secret SECRET --profile serverless-admin\n\nHow to Invoke. Deploy. and See Logs of Serverless Lambda Functions\nTo create a new service or function. use the sls create command along with the appropriate template and path. You can get a list of available templates using sls create --help command. For example. to create a Python service:\n\nsls create --template aws-python --path myService\n\nTo deploy this function to AWS. use sls deploy. If you want to deploy a specific function only. use sls deploy function -f functionName.\n\nTo test a function on AWS. use the sls invoke -f functionName command. Adding the --log flag shows the function logs directly in the console. You can also get function logs separately using sls logs -f functionName.\n\nWhat is AWS SAM and How to Set it Up on MacOS\nAWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions. APIs. databases. and event source mappings.\n\nTo install AWS CLI and SAM on MacOS. first. install the AWS CLI:\n\nbrew install awscli\n\nNext. install AWS SAM:\n\nbrew tap aws/tap brew install aws-sam-cli\n\nInitialize a new SAM application using sam init. choose your desired runtime (e.g.. Python). and template. To build your application. navigate to the project directory and use sam build.\n\nYou can invoke your function locally using sam local invoke. For an API. you can start a local API Gateway with sam local start-api.\n\nTo deploy your application. use sam deploy --guided. You can then invoke it using sam local invoke \"FunctionName\".\n\nIf you need to delete your stack for any reason. you can do so with the aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM_APP_NAME --region us-east-1 command.\n\nYou can also use SAM with the VSCode AWS Toolkit. Press Cmd+Shift+P in VSCode. click on \"Add Debug Configuration\" above a handler function and run Docker to start debugging.\n\nFor Python packages management. you can install the serverless-python-requirements plugin by running sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements. This will automatically bundle required packages.\n\nConclusion and Why Serverless is Useful for Cost-Saving\nAs you can see. the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM greatly simplify the process of creating. deploying. and managing serverless applications. Moreover. by leveraging these tools. we can focus more on the application's business logic rather than infrastructure management.\n\nServerless architecture is not only efficient but also cost-effective. As there are no servers to manage. it eliminates the costs related to idle time. You pay only for the execution time of your functions. which leads to significant cost savings. especially for applications with variable workloads.\n\nWe hope this guide has provided you with a clear understanding of how to get started with the Serverless Framework and AWS SAM on a MacOS machine.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nMACHINE LEARNING\nThe One-size-fits-all ML-project template?\nA problem. framework. budget. library. language agnostic approach to ML\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n7 JUL 2023 ‚Ä¢ 8 MIN READ\n\nCOMMUNITY\nA year of driving tech @ IITM\nA journey of impacting 2000+ students in 365 days. 40+ projects. a 20 member insane team and 1 fricking vision\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n15 JUN 2023 ‚Ä¢ 12 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

We upscaled the tech culture at the institute through organizing 20+ competitions. 15+ guest lectures - resulting in 22\nproducts. events impacting 2000+ students. I‚Äôd personally recommend this to any person who shares these 2 traits -\n\npassion of driving a solid tech culture at our university\nwillingness to test their limits to stand for something bigger than themselves\nI‚Äôll talk mainly about 6 things about my tenure as TechSoc Head from 2022 to 2023. where we captured the engagement of over 2000+ students. having conducted 15+ guest lectures and 20+ technical events.\n\nThe Initiatives\nThe Experience\nThe Growth\nThe De-merits\nA crazy story\nCool stuff I got to do\nFYI - Although this blog is all motivational stuff. we failed a tonne of times. but we did end up making people smile and make amazing things - and that's what it's all about.\n\nThe initiatives\nMy approach was and always has been - invest in the team. then invest in the customer and then invest in the future. The fun part about this 3 step process is the more you invest in the earlier phases. you're actually also investing well enough in the latter parts.\n\nInvesting in the team\nThe most important part was always that each member on the team felt proud and challenged and happy about the work we did. They had to grow. they had to be happy and challenge their own problem solving skills - else it wasn't worth it.\n\nSo here are a couple things I tried and liked:\n\n\nnot the full team. some suckers missed picture day\nA training period\nSpent atleast a month for new joinees to get used to \"entrepreneurial activities\" - like studying companies. making presentations and pitching. drafting detailed reports. running collaborative projects. cold emailing. corporate relations. This helped the team learn a lot in a short period of time and gain confidence.\n\nHere's a syllabus if it helps - link\n\nBut yeah. if you want top-quality. hard-working. smart people actually working with you on your vision - gotta train your army to fight. You can start by defining the vision of your team. and what culture you want to carry into this.\n\nMeeting structuring\nCollege is a complex time with lotta priorities. commitments and spontaneous plans. It is important to have a definite meeting structure so that you stay consistent and add a punctuality aspect to respect everyone's time.\n\nIf anyone came late. they bought ice-cream to everyone who came before.\nIf the meeting didn't end on time. then I would buy ice-cream for everyone in the meeting\nEvery meeting had a document and actionables that people could take back so we always met with a direction. discussed agenda as per time and walked away with usable data and direction.\nThis structure is something I learned from Sharavanakumar at Khatabook and to this day. I'm grateful for it.\n\nOKRs\nOKRs - helping break down the overall vision into just 3 things each of the 18 of us had to get right each week - while working with each other. We were 18 disruptors - 54 things per week. pointing in 1 direction - helped us grow like crazy.\n\nTeam Happiness and Culture\nAt TechSoc. you always get a birthday cake. If you're in person - team folks even show up for your celebration at 12AM. We ensured that in our weekly retros. we had shoutouts for everyone who did great work in that week. Every event we saved on. the surplus would go back to team treats and gifting goodies. We were transparent about our money and trusted each other with it. Apart from that. we'd enjoy late night sessions on the lawns playing games (Mafia. Truth and Dare. \"Albatross\") or singing or sharing stories about ourselves.\n\nInvesting in the experience\n\ngive them pizza. they will build amazing things\nEvery event at TechSoc was a collaboration with another technical team on campus. And they're usually busy with projects but do want the publicity on campus. Every meeting we had with them. went as follows:\n\nWhy are we doing this event? What do we want to takeback from it\nWhat does the event do? What's the best date and why?\nHow will the overall flow of conducting look like?\nHow do we market it?\nWhat do we need (human resources and props) to run it successfully?\nWhat are some loopholes we should consider when organizing this?\nMetrics tracking and SWOT analysis\nAll this information would then be captured in a document - sample. This document would contain all the plan. the necessary links and people collaborating on it.\n\nOn ground. here are some values we ensured each time we conducted the event\n\nParticipant is god. If it means you're cycling with one hand and doing repeated samosa deliveries. sticking posters everywhere or ensuring that they have water - you gotta do it.\nTechSoc never gives up. No matter how much things screw-up. And they did. like. all the time. Once there was an internet issue in a seminar we were streaming while a billion dollar CEO waited on the other end. But we recouped and did the damn thing\nAfter-event work happens super fast. Everything from prizes. to score updation. to social media. website updating and everything.\nInvesting in the big picture\n\nMandakini hostel team. who made a car that did obstacle detection realtime\n\"Always build on top of your previous work\". A lot of what we did at TechSoc compounded in on itself over time. We started with arguing and justfying INR 7000 rupee budgets for paper plane events and in 1 year got to INR 1.5 lakh AI hackathons. The way to do this was:\n\nUpdate the fricking website - ensure that the overall presence of TechSoc was always up to date with everything that we had achieved so other people could review. With time. as we did more things. we became more awesome and it kept compounding with time. This helped get external attention and investment as well.\nBuild extensive documentation - Every document. going in. with time. created such a strong clarity and database - everything from important contacts to event documents and plans and costs and the whole thing - just mind-blowing. It helped a lot of people collaborate and introspect and evolve work with time.\nAlign everyone. Repeatedly - Every meeting. or party. or failure point - it was super important to just tell everyone what we stand for.\nThe Experience\nTechnical Society is a relatively growing student body and so the job is obviously hard. The place my team had to start from was how to even get 5 people to show up for an offline event when we were reeling back from the pandemic. Key points of my experience are:\n\n\nthe aero contingent team from our university (L to R - Akshat. Ayush. Pranit. Reddy Anna. my Alak boi. Sukriti)\nIt‚Äôs a fricking rollercoaster - There are events that go super well and then there are others where 0 people show up. My highs were really high and lows were equally painful. I‚Äôve wanted to quit and dump so many times but then there were equally balanced nights of euphoria and adrenaline\nIt‚Äôs about the team- Investing in the team‚Äôs growth during the summer following my recruitment was one of the best decisions I made. Because this strong loyal team stood while we encountered multiple hits over failed early events in the first semester. And now I see the same shy-to-even-turn-on-their-video-camera students stay up 14 straight hours. jugaading food and leading the conduction of tech events on campus.\nDiplomacy is everything - I‚Äôve had to be nice in multiple f-you conversations and taken a lot of sit from multiple participants and stakeholders at a lot of points. Being rational more than emotional. knowing the right words to pitch to the right decision maker for an approval. collaborating with other student bodies for mutual vision alignment - that kind of thing\nThe tech community has heart - Tech-community is introverted. reserved and fit the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù description (barring a few outliers). But these are the same people who will pour their heart out for finessing a project - right from scribbling on whiteboards to presenting products. stand by and help each other for free. bond over late night tea conversations and pizzas. fight when they‚Äôre sleep deprived and drive real impact to push the society forward. This inspirational set of people is worth fighting for\nThe Growth\nGigantic network - This is the most golden essence of being in an technology college. I reached out far and wide:\n\ninteracted and connected with the most passionate tech enthusiasts across all domains at my university\nconnected to nationwide college's top talent through a joint Tech board\nbecame part of a top class university entrepreneur community\nmultiple companies (GitHub. Unacademy) that sponsored our events\nBeing a better planner - Every TechSoc event had to be granularly figured out - right from the why. to the domain. to the logistics (approvals. finances. food). marketing plans. grading patterns. feedback loop and process documentation. And prior to that - figuring out which initiatives to run for which target audience and how that tied into the TechSoc vision to provide something to students that they were missing out on.\n\nTechSoc taught me about this more than anything. You have to be a better planner than you ever were when you‚Äôre handling over 5 Lakhs of budget and getting around 30-40 things right in stressful weeks.\n\nBecoming a stronger person - A leader is looked up to be a responsible and strong person. But no one is born that way. You learn by getting hit with a brick in the face. I learnt to be resilient. have more patience. lose the fear of crowd handling. stand my ground in hard negotations. take in a lot of negative feedback and deal with some failures. There were a lot of times when I felt like running away from the problem but the beauty of this PoR is that it won‚Äôt let you. Even when you‚Äôre tired. or tied by administration or resource constrained and super close to giving up. It has definitely increased my self-confidence to stand up to any problem in the world with a - ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre TechSoc. we‚Äôll figure it out‚Äù attitude.\n\nBeing part of something bigger - I had a chance to stand for a strong tech culture at my college - even though it sometimes meant being unhealthily altruistic. Looking back. I‚Äôll have not regretted that I spent my last year complaining about not having a strong tech scene at univer. I‚Äôll carry with me the legacy of having led highly passionate believers who wanted to push the limits of what technology can be.\n\nThe De-merits\n\npassing out after 40hrs on non stop competition work and logistics\nConstantly stressed - In the early days. especially with the offline shift and even during the competitions. I felt responsible for too many things. It‚Äôs an unprecedented level of stress - that no one should rationally take. Passion might be good reason to do it. but not otherwise. You‚Äôre worried for an event. a team member‚Äôs growth. someone resigning. some plan getting delayed and simultaneously 0 participation in another event on the next day. Since the team is small. unlike other bodies. you‚Äôre involved personally in most things and while the growth is good - the cost it comes at. is also high\nPersonal sacrifices - Barely any time on most weekends. I remember just bouncing across meetings post 8pm on a lot of weekdays and then standing by the team. I‚Äôve missed a lot of social life. sometimes even personal goals (heck. I didn‚Äôt work on my startup during national competitions) and relaxing. as I struggled to move the needles of 3 different verticals whilst the cores were still warming up. The role does take a lot out of you and it‚Äôs not a good thing always.\nA lot of ground-work - My leadership style has always been more hands-on. Might be a good or bad thing. I don‚Äôt know the balance. There are days when people won‚Äôt work upto your standards and you‚Äôll have to step in and help even though you really are just mad and might want to panic and yell at them to get it done. Compassion taught me to share the load - right from being a TShirt distributor to a sweeper to poster designer to food delivery agent.\nA crazy story\nI'll tell a story of how I learnt persistence. In 2023. I was leading a 90 member contingent from our university to participate in Inter IIT Tech Meet (a national level competition for solving technical challenges). I was managing 15 projects over 2 months and was also in charge of the logistics. travel and accommodation in Kanpur. I booked the train tickets for my contingent through our institute and they assured us of tickets to Kanpur. However. in on the day of travel. amidst 100+ things I juggled all the way upto the train station. I realized that our tickets from Chennai to Kanpur were waitlisted. The train was full and keeping in mind the safety of my team. I told them to get off and said we'd find another way. And so. this story begins with a huge group ¬†of people. staring down at me at 12am on a railway station. with hopes that I'd get them to our competition - 2000 miles away - in the next 36 hours.\n\nI arranged for a bus back to the campus and stayed up till 3. trying to figure out how I'd get my team to Kanpur safely. with the limited budget I had. For context. our institute had a no-flight refund policy for competitions. We brainstormed multiple routes via permutations of bus and train but we'd reach late and fatigued. At 3:15am. Shreepoorna found a reasonable flight ticket deal from Chennai to Delhi. At 3:30am. I poured in all my personal savings of about INR 85000 (with a INR 10000 loan) and booked the tickets to Kanpur. Here's the celebration video of that too.\n\n\nthe moment the tickets for kanpur were booked at 3:30am (gut feeling- all these people are going to make great founders 1 day)\nNext. I spent 2 hours breaking it to the 2 people. whose tickets couldn't be booked due to limited funds. At 4am. I was standing at Cauvery Hostel. getting rattled by a junior on how I'd failed my entire purpose as a leader. Returning to my room in a mess. I wrote a long email to the Dean. explaining the situtation before I passed out.\n\nAfter a 1 hr nap. I woke up in cold sweats. informing our Dean with a long email - the entire situation. 9am. I showed up to their office. shaking. But the admin rallied with us and with their support. got the tickets for the remaining team as well.\n\nAfter 2 hours we flew to Delhi. In-flight. I worked with the people solving the \"entrepreneurship challenge\" and got their submission right. Abhishek Gupta (on campus) was making the pitch deck all the way to 12 when we submitted it. before we finally got kicked out of the cafe we made our makeshift office. with just a single coffee order. Next. at Delhi. we haggled and arranged bus transport to Kanpur for all with a 40% discount. Turns out. back then. online bookings weren't considered valid and you had to physically haggle and get people in the bus.\n\nFun fact. we got screwed over by the bus guys who dropped us about 25km away and once again. stranded on a highway at 7am. our team is bargaining with auto drivers to get us there.\n\nFinally. after the entire long journey. we reached Kanpur campus 10 hours before time. 24 hours after that. with a parched throat. I pitched and won the silver medal for my college at the entrepreneurship challenge. Oh and the savings I put in? I got them reimbursed a month later by tweaking around my cloud provider SaaS costs and showing AWS credits as expenditure (technically. I did lose the money).\n\nThis is my favourite story that I like to share as I can neither put it in my resume nor will it be a conventional interview question - but it is so fundamental to my way of working - Persistence. I'd rather sweat in a garage than recline in a cabin. Cause where other's see unconvention. I see genius. \"Ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. are the ones who really do\"\n\nHere's another story blog I wrote about an initiative TechSoc created and ran - to motivate students to believe and build projects - link\n\nCoolest things I got to do\nOrganized the 1st paper plane flying contest at my university. with having only semi-permission for the badminton courts\nRevived a culture of building finished products in 10 weeks through BuildSchool\nEarnt a chance to lead the Tech Contingent and shout a war cry on the stage (Actual onstage video - link)\n\nInstitute Tech Team picture day. \"Veer Madrasi - Aadi Kole\".

Let me know if there are any improvements you want me to look at.\n\nAnd with that. let's dive in. into the product flow\n\n\n\nWhat does a cloud engineer do?\nFirst. let's understand how cloud architects function and come up with infrastructure solutions for a given business problem. See. as a typical cloud architect - the flow is as follows\n\nStep 0: - It starts with a problem statement such as a architecture for payment gateway or a data migration pipeline or a high availability server fleet setup.\nStep 1: Ask the right questions - Several times. we go back and forth with the problem statement to understand what are the exact business requirements and what are important aspects that we need to optimize for.\nStep 2: Research - With the given requirements. the standard approach is to go online. read up some blogs by cloud providers. read case studies and open source articles to get context and understand our problem statement. Here. typically a lot of time is just spent in finding the right article. Most software problems have precedents that have solved the requirement wholly or in parts. Hence. finding the right documentation for similar requirements is of paramount importance.\nStep 3: Technical Requirements - Once we have asked the right questions. we prepare a brief technical document. highlighting the most important performance expectations from the software and then start researching what kind of cloud offerings do we require. We also quantify that to what extent do we want to look at satisfying a particular goal. eg: 500 TB of storage. 80ms latency in communication. 7 0s of availability. 8GB GPUs for ML training.\nStep 4: List the building blocks - Here. we simply map each techinal requirement to an existing cloud service we can use and do a comparative analysis. If it's ML. it's gotta be Google Cloud. for availability and cost. it's gotta be AWS - that kinda thing. So we start listing cloud offerings such as EC2 (AWS). Maps API (Google Cloud) or Azure OpenAI (Microsoft Azure). We think of using these offerings as builing blocks for the entire architecture and justify why the offering is important\nStep 5: Join the blocks - Here. we join together the building blocks as services that communicate with 1 another and draw a systems diagram that helps to understand how the overall system works. Which part does what function and how it's role fits into the overall requirement.\nStep 6: Iterate - Once an end-to-end flow is ready. we do overall Product. Engineering and Cost Analysis and then we iterate upon the design to optimize for certain aspects - make it faster. make it cheaper. increase the storage. increase the redundancy - that kind of thing. And based on that. we improve the choice of building blocks and integrating them together in 1 system\nStep 7: Templatize - Once a cloud architecture is ready. we start looking at using Cloud templates such as CloudFormation by AWS. Terraform by Hashicorp to easily just deploy the entire architecture and have a skeleton of it functional to understand performance on a practical level.\nThus. this is the overall flow of the entirety of coming up with a cloud architecture. Beautiful and methodical.\n\nSo if we were to copilotize this process we would need an AI agent who could read through all cloud architecture related blogs. docs. case-studies like an engineer and intuitively go through steps 1 to 8 and help arrive upon a solution.\n\nAnd that's why we used something called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique where we retrieved the right list of documents from the internet and asked our Large Language Model to generate an answer from text that it studied from these docs.\n\nBefore we segway into what we did. let's study in short - what is this \"Retrieval Augmented Generation\" anyways?\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\n\nImagine you're a chef and you're trying to create a new dish. First. you go to your pantry (which has a vast array of ingredients). This is akin to the retrieval part. You take a look at different recipes you have used in the past or a recipe book for ideas. You fetch or 'retrieve' ingredients and inspiration based on these recipes.\n\nNext. you start to combine these ingredients together. perhaps in a way you've never done before. You might modify some of the recipes to match your taste or to make the dish unique. This is similar to the 'generation' part of the process.\n\nNow. let's say you have some guests coming over and you know their preferences. To accommodate them. you decide to modify your new dish even further or add some garnish to make it look more appealing. This is comparable to the 'augmentation' part. where you make some tweaks to make the final result better suited for its purpose.\n\nBringing it back to the context of AI and natural language processing. Retrieval-Generated Augmentation is a method where you:\n\n'Retrieve' relevant data or content from a large dataset (like a chef searching through the pantry or recipe books).\n'Generate' new data or content based on this retrieved data (like a chef creating a new dish using the fetched ingredients). and then\n'Augment' this generated content. usually by making some modifications to better suit the task at hand (like a chef adjusting the dish to suit the guests' taste).\nThis method is very useful for tasks that involve generating text or other types of data. especially when you want to produce content that is tailored for a specific task. purpose. or audience.\n\nIt's also a way to improve the performance of machine learning models. by providing them with a richer. more varied dataset to learn from. The richer and more varied the 'ingredients' (i.e.. the data). the better the 'dish' (i.e.. the model's output) can potentially be.\n\n\n\nHow we built the damn thing\nPart 1: \"Retrieve\"\nFor this we would leverage the open-source documents. blogs. systems diagrams and articles by major Cloud Providers such as AWS. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.\n\nWe created a custom index of just these documents. Using Amazon Kendra. we indexed over 192000 such information webpages using its web-connector. Here. the major difficulty we faced was understanding which XML sitemaps did we have to index and how. Some documents were in Japanese and some were just plain irrelevant marketing content. So intelligent document structure filtering was required at this level to index the right documents for our search.\n\nThus. this helped us to get the best documents to pull in for a given query. For example the queries below.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Kendra for getting top documents for a given search query\nPart 2: \"Generate\"\nAlright so you've got the top 10 documents you're supposed to refer to. But how can we improve the experience of gleaning valuable insights for your given business problem? That's where we use the superpower of an LLM. It's like asking it to read all documents and answer over it\n\nSo. once we \"retrieve\" the documents from Amaz√∏n Kendra. we ask the LLM to take the top 5 most relevant documents. pass all the text in them as tokens to the LLM (number of tokens varies depending on the LLM. we used GPT-4 by OpenAI that takes in upto 8000 tokens). The LLM parses the text and via few-shot learning over the context of business problem and the documents from Kendra. \"generates\" a response for the end user.\n\nThis is the simple task. Get the relevant docs and then generate a textual response from the same. Let's improve the experience now.\n\n\n\nPart 3: The end-to-end architecture\nStringing together this in an entire experience involved developing the following flow.\n\nGet the input prompt for the business requirement from the user and generate a set of relevant questions about the business to ask the user. For this we used an LLM\n\n\nWe recorded the question answers and the business requirement. did some text summarization and trimming (using nltk to remove whitespaces. punctuations etc.) and then we pass it all as a cumulative context for searching best documents in Amazon Kendra\n\nNext. we get the best docuements from Amazon Kendra as text. combine that with business prompt and QnA and pass it to our LLM for giving a textual response\n\nOnce we get the response. we return that. along with hyperlinks to the documents that Kendra returned so the user can get our summarized.structured answer as well as refer the source documents for more information at their own leisure\n\nTo help the cloud engineer with more specific information. we added a feature to generate the following from the textual answer\n6. Systems diagram for the architecture proposed to understand how to link together the building blocks\n7. IaaC code template - Basically a CloudFormation code template to quickly just spin up the architecture and study its performance and behavior in cloud\n8. Cost estimation - based on information that the LLM has been trained on. using AWS pricing docs as data source\n\nLastly. we provided a chat interface for the user to keep passing more requirements (such as \"make it cheaper?\". \"make the system faster?\") to the service. Now. we pass a combination of these 4 things to the LLM to get an improved answer = original business prompt + QnA + generated answer + additional user request\n\n\n\nWhat can we improve upon?\nHere's the current complete system that was built:\n\n\n\nOkay so this project was awesomely exciting but the main complaint I have from it is that it is too slow. It still takes 2 minutes to generate answers and diagrams. A way to improve that would be some compute on frontend or some level of caching\n\nAlso. the answers are still generic and unless the prompt is well-engineered. we wouldn't discover novel architectures and solutions. So. that's something we need to fine-tune for. Maybe some sort of a framework for the user to engineer their prompt even better. Asking better technical requirement questions for a given business prompt could be a good starting point.\n\nLastly. it's expensive. Kendra is expensive and so is using OpenAI. So the approach for solving this is - open-source it! A search index with Elasticsearch combined with a custom LLM such as the Llama. Lima and Flan-T5 models can help cut down on costs\n\nOooh. a cool feature could have also using voice to speech and language translation (with using localized cloud services docs) to provide multilingual support to our beloved copilot\n\nIn closing....\nWe're having a copilot for pretty much everything these days ever since the Generative AI hype cycle started so I just thought of creating something that could help engineers to better adopt the Cloud Services by any cloud and help leverage them in the best possible way\n\nHere are some useful reference links:\n\nBuilding a Retrieval Augmented System using an LLM\n\nIndexing web documents using Amazon Kendra\n\nLet's see how fast you get from 0 to cloud.\n\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nCOMMUNITY\nA year of driving tech @ IITM\nA journey of impacting 2000+ students in 365 days. 40+ projects. a 20 member insane team and 1 fricking vision\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n15 JUN 2023 ‚Ä¢ 12 MIN READ\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nCoursepanel: My 1st startup\nWhat I innovated and struggled as I tried to build my 1st software business\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n31 MAR 2023 ‚Ä¢ 6 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

And we did realize it. atleast for 3000+ students in my undergraduate college.\n\nI ran Coursepanel for a year and we built several cool things in this journey. I'll keep this blog fairly technical but also throw in certain snippets about entrepreneurship and lessons learnt along the way. Most of this blog is going to be about the technical implementation of this project. I have mentioned my learnings as an entrepreneur in the end.\n\nTo read the story of the early days and launch. checkout - here\n\n\nTechnical Deep-dive\nUnderstanding Natural Language Processing and Vector Embeddings\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science. artificial intelligence. and linguistics. It involves programming computers to effectively process large amounts of natural language data. As part of NLP. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3. developed by OpenAI. are designed to generate human-like text based on the inputs they receive. They are trained on a diverse range of internet text and can generate contextually relevant text.\n\nHowever. they do not know specific documents or sources they were trained on and don't have the capability to access or retrieve specific documents or databases during the generation process. Their strength lies in understanding and generating text that closely resembles human-like responses. thus forming a key part of systems like CourseGPT.\n\nVector embeddings are another crucial component of such systems. In the realm of machine learning. embeddings are a way to convert categorical variables into continuous vectors so as to feed them into a model. They can be used to capture the semantics of words in a language. relationships between items. and even user behavior in an application.\n\n\nBasic demo of how words are converted into vector embeddings (source)\n\nThese embeddings. when stored in a vector database. form the basis of effective search and recommendation systems.\n\nBuilding a vector database using a knowledge graph\nFor the purpose of this project. based on the previous training data. we turned our knowledge graph (aka ‚Äúskillmap‚Äù) into a vector database for storing entries and answering queries related to academic data. This was done in 4 steps:\n\nCreating a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j: The first step involved modeling our data as a graph and storing it in Neo4j. Our nodes represent entities such as NPTEL courses. books. departments. etc.. and relationships represented the connections between these entities\nGenerating Vector Embeddings: The next step involved generating vector embeddings from our graph. These embeddings are a form of representation that captures the semantic meaning and relationships of your data in the form of vectors in a high-dimensional space. There are several techniques to generate graph embeddings. like Node2Vec. GraphSAGE. etc. This project used the Node2Vec library in Python to achieve the same. We ran Node2Vec algorithms on our Neo4j graph to generate node and relationship embeddings.\nStore Vector Embeddings: The generated embeddings then needed to be stored for future use. Typically. we‚Äôd want a database that is optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors. You could use a vector database like Pinecone. Faiss. or even Elasticsearch with a vector plugin for this purpose.\nQuerying the Vector Database: The final part involved using these vector embeddings to make our application smarter. For example. we could now perform operations like semantic search. recommendations. or similarity checks by comparing vectors. This involved querying our vector database for the nearest vectors to a given input vector. which gave us the most semantically similar entities to our query.\nScoping NPTEL data into the Vector Database and building a chatbot\nTo create a system like CourseGPT. we first need to load the relevant data into the vector database. Let's assume we have course data from NPTEL in a CSV format. This data can be processed and converted into vector embeddings using various techniques like Word2Vec. GloVe. or even using transformers-based models. These vector representations can then be loaded into the vector database. which allows us to perform efficient similarity search operations.\n\nThe vector database enables us to compare the query vector (which can be a representation of a user's query or a specific course interest) with all vectors in our database. and retrieves the most similar entries. These entries represent courses that are most relevant to the user's query.\n\nOnce the entries are returned. we need to translate these course vectors back into a human-readable form. This is where LLMs like GPT-3 come into play. These models can generate contextually relevant. human-like text based on the returned entries. The generated text can be as simple as a course name and description. or as complex as a detailed career path recommendation.\n\nIn this way. the synergy of NLP. LLMs. and vector databases leads to the development of an effective system like CourseGPT. Such a system can revolutionize the way we approach professional upskilling and corporate training by providing personalized. contextual. and interactive learning experiences.\n\nThe journey in a nutshell\nThe development and evolution of CourseGPT. spread over a 12-month period. could've been a significant step forward in the application of advanced technologies such as AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP). and Knowledge Graphs to the critical area of professional upskilling and corporate training.\n\nThe journey began with understanding the problem domain. setting the objectives and scope. and constructing the methodology flowchart. The decision to pick a test sandbox environment of similar nature proved instrumental in aligning the development of CourseGPT closely with the real-world challenges encountered in professional learning and development.\n\nDeep dives into models of corporate training. specifically the Kirkpatrick Model. provided insights into the metrics for successful training outcomes. Skill mapping using a knowledge graph emerged as a novel and efficient approach to resolving course recommendations and facilitating an effective learning journey for the students.\n\nWorking with the NPTEL team and building a skill map for IIT Madras underscored the potential of this tool in academic environments as well. Implementing Natural Entity Recognition and NLP allowed us to extract valuable course tags and derive meaningful insights from the data.\n\nMoreover. the research conducted at HyperVerge Academy (HVA) enabled a deeper understanding of the professional upskilling space. Facing and overcoming various challenges along the way. we succeeded in developing a competency engine and data model that significantly enriched the capabilities of CourseGPT.\n\nFinally. CourseGPT emerged as an intelligent product. leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs to recommend courses based on career goals. plan academic journeys. solve student doubts. and inclusively cater to diverse learners. The journey. although filled with complexities and challenges. offered valuable insights into the future of AI-enabled learning and set a foundation for ongoing research and development.\n\nHere's the various launch videos of products that I built. just as a nostalgic flash from the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I failed to run it as a company.\nWith Coursepanel. we made around 35000 INR in revenue with 3000+ free users and then got stuck in a loop of developing without continuous customer interaction. I shut down Coursepanel in May 2023. I was embarassed. mentally disturbed and self-doubting when I did it. It was hard and it was like I had given up on a dream ¬†and failed myself. But picking up and moving on is the way forward. Here are a few things I learnt from this experience - these aren't novel learnings - these are the same fuckups most startup folks advise against but I did it anyway and learnt it again - at a heavy price:\n\nDon't do it alone. It's not that I'm doubting individual capability - it's just that context switching has a very difficult toll when you ¬†want strong velocity in both business and innovaiton. Also there's the emotional burden of doing it alone. Worst case. atleast have a friend to talk to and help sort out a lot of operations and communications\nIt's best to build a shitty product with continuous customer interaction but no point of siloed building. no matter what you feel about current systems. Even asking and then building then again asking then building - i.e. an intermittent month-to-month setup might not help. Atleast talk to users each week.\nMake money from the start. It's the only way to stay afloat.\nDon't get to emotionally attached to your innovation or amazed by exciting new things you can do. Focus on the minimum that gets you paid. get it right and then expand with bolder experiments.\nIt's boring and requires discipline and routine to continuously outperform other teams. You have to consistently just keep pushing. Motivation is 2/3rds of this game.\n\nSo yeah. I guess that's about it. I was very passionate. worked very hard and was heartbroken - but I guess I'm carrying forward a lot - something that classroom would have never taught me. Let's see. I'm about to do something again in the Generative AI space. This time - business first though - get the \"what are people gonna pay for\" right and then expand from that base thought into technical innovation and exquisite design.\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP\nBaking customer obsession into everyday decisions\n15 Jan 2024 ‚Äì 3 min read\n\nProblem to Product\n27 Feb 2023 ‚Äì 6 min read\n\nLearning from Unusual Billionaires\n15 Dec 2022 ‚Äì 7 min read\n\nSee all 9 posts ‚Üí\n\nGENERATIVE AI\nRAG-ging like a boss with AI\nHow we indexed all of AWS.

That is why you see ‚Äúmarket disruptions‚Äù: when a new type of product (solution space) better meets the market needs (problem space)\nThe ‚Äúwhat‚Äù describes the benefits that the product should give the customer‚Äîwhat the product will accomplish for the user or allow the user to accomplish.\nThe ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the way in which the product delivers the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to the customer. The ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù is problem space and ‚Äúhow‚Äù is solution space.\nüí°\nWhat = problem space\nHow = solution space\nLean product teams articulate the hypotheses they have made and solicit customer feedback on early design ideas to test those hypotheses.\n\nShould you listen to customers?\nIt‚Äôs true that customers aren‚Äôt going to lead you to the Promised Land of a break-through innovative product. but customer feedback is like a flashlight in the night: it keeps you from falling off a cliff as you try to find your way there.\n\nUsing the solution space to discover the problem space\nHard for customers to talk about abstract benefits and the relative importance of each‚Äîand when they do. it‚Äôs often fraught with inaccuracies\nThis can be solved by techniques like \"contextual inquiry\" or \"customer discovery\"\nThe reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. If you show them a new product or design. they can tell you what they like and don‚Äôt like. They can compare it to other solutions and identify pros and cons.\nThe best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created\nDivergent and convergent thinking\nYou should be practicing divergent thinking. which means trying to generate as many ideas as possible without any judgment or evalua-tion. There will be plenty of time later for convergent thinking. where you evaluate the ideas and decide which ones you think are the most promising.\n\nyou want to capture all the ideas that your team generated. then organize them by the benefit that they deliver.\nThen. for each benefit. you want to review and prioritize the list of feature ideas.\nYou can score each idea on expected customer value to determine a first-pass priority.\nThe goal is to identify the top three to five features for each benefit.\nThere is not much value in looking beyond those top features right now because things will change‚Äîa lot‚Äîafter you show your prototype to customers.\nA user story is a brief description of the benefit that the particular functionality should provide. including whom the benefit is for (the target customer). and why the customer wants the benefit.\n\nüí°\nAs a [type of user]. I want to [do something]. so that I can [desired benefit].\n¬†eg : As a professional photographer.I want to easily upload pictures from my camera to my website.so that I can quickly show my clients their pictures. ¬†\n\nüí°\nINVEST framework\nI - independent of other stories\nN - not explicit and must be flexible. open for discussion\nV - valuable to customer\nE - reasonlaby estimate scope\nS - small\nT - testable\n¬†\n\nSmall tickets and smaller ticket batch sizes are better\nBreak tickets into atomic chunks. Trim extra stuff\nThe batch size is the number of products worked on together at the same time in parallel. Faster velocity of small batches -> faster feedback -> reduce risk and waste\nThe longer you work on a product with-out getting customer feedback. the more you risk a major disconnect that subsequently requires significant rework.\nScoping with story points\nStory points - type of currency for estimating relative ticket size\nHave a max threshold for story points\nGood operating principle ¬†- break down stories with high points into smaller stories\nReturn on investment to prioritize\nWhen you are building a product or feature. the investment is usually the time that your development resources spend working on it. which you generally measure in units such as developer-weeks (one developer working for one week).\nIt‚Äôs true that you could probably calculate an equivalent dollar amount. but people use units like developer-weeks because they are simpler and clearer\nVisualizing ROI\n\nGood product teams strive to come up with ideas like idea G in Figure 6.1‚Äîthe ones that create high customer value for low effort.\nGreat product teams are able to take ideas like that. break them down into chunks. trim off less valuable pieces. and identify creative ways to deliver the customer value with less effort than initially scoped‚Äîindicated in the figure by moving idea G to the left.\nThe accuracy of the estimates should be proportional to the fidelity of the product definition\nThe main point of these calculations is less about figuring out actual ROI values and more about how they compare to each other\n¬†\n\nApproximating ROI and Deciding on MVP candidate\n\nJust comparing feature importance wrt one another. Once that‚Äôs done. arrange all features in this format as per benefit categories\n\n\nIntentionally give them generic names so that you can more easily envision replacing them with what would be relevant for your product. ‚ÄúM1A‚Äù means feature chunk A for must-have 1. ‚ÄúP2B‚Äù means feature chunk B for perfor-mance benefit 2. and ‚ÄúD2C‚Äù means feature chunk C for delighter benefit 21.\nDecide on the MINIMUM SET OF FUNCTIONALITY that will resonate with TG users\nLook down the leftmost column of feature chunks and determine which ones you think need to be in your MVP candidate. While doing so. you should refer to your product value proposition\nAfter this. focus on the main performance benefit you‚Äôre planning to use to beat the competition\nDelighters are part of your differentiation. too. You should include your top delighter in your MVP candidate.\nSo if you‚Äôve made tentative plans beyond your MVP. you must be prepared to throw them out the window and come up with new plans based on what you learn from customers.\n\nMoving on to MVP and early Prototyping\nUse the broad term MVP ‚Äúprototype‚Äù to capture the wide range of items you can test with cus-tomers to gain learning. While the first ‚Äúprototype‚Äù you test could be your live MVP. you can gain faster learning with fewer resources by testing your hypotheses before you build your MVP.\n\nWhat is/isn't an MVP?\n\nThere has been spirited debate over what qualifies as an MVP. Some people argue vehemently that a landing page is a valid MVP. Others say it isn‚Äôt. insisting that an MVP must be a real. working product or at least an interactive prototype.\nThe way I resolve this dichotomy is to realize that these are all methods to test the hypotheses behind your MVP. By using the term ‚ÄúMVP tests‚Äù instead of MVP. the debate goes away\nProduct vs Marketing MVP Tests\n\nMarketing test - You‚Äôre simply describing the functionality to prospective customers to see how compelling they find your description\nMVP Tests - validate your product will involve showing prospective customers functionality to solicit their feedback on it. You may be showing them a live beta product or just low fidelity wireframes to assess product-market fit\nMarketing tests can provide valuable learning. but they‚Äôre not an actual product that creates customer value. At some point. you need to test a prototype of your MVP candidate\nQuantitative vs Qualitative MVP Tests\n\nQualitative - you are talking with customers directly. usually in small numbers that don‚Äôt yield statistical significance eg: If. for example. you conducted one-on-one feedback sessions with 12 prospective customers to solicit their feedback on a mockup of your landing page. then that would be qualitative research\n\nQuantitative - conducting the test at scale with alarge number of customers. ¬†You don‚Äôt care as much about any indi-vidual result and are instead interested in the aggregate results.\n\neg: If you launched two versions of your landing page and directed thousands of customers to each one to see which one had the higher conversion rate. then that would be a quantitative test.\n\nQuant = what. how; Qual = why\n\nQuantitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow many‚Äù: what actions customers took and how many customers took an action (e.g.. clicked on the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button). But quantitative tests will not tell you why they chose to do so or why the other customers chose not to do so. In contrast. qualitative tests are good for learning ‚Äúwhy‚Äù: the reasons behind different customers‚Äô decisions to take an action or not.\n\nMatrix of MVP Tests\n\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\nMORE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP\nBaking customer obsession into everyday decisions\n15 Jan 2024 ‚Äì 3 min read\n\nCoursepanel: My 1st startup\n31 Mar 2023 ‚Äì 6 min read\n\nLearning from Unusual Billionaires\n15 Dec 2022 ‚Äì 7 min read\n\nSee all 9 posts ‚Üí\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nCoursepanel: My 1st startup\nWhat I innovated and struggled as I tried to build my 1st software business\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n31 MAR 2023 ‚Ä¢ 6 MIN READ\n\nHello OKRs\nüí°If you don't know where you're going. you might not get there Objective Key-Result (OKR) is a framework of approaching a goal/project that ensures that you and your team\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n13 JAN 2023 ‚Ä¢ 2 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

If you're curious. this person learnt the OKR framework from top management at Intel and replicated successfully. the same principles - at Google and grew the young startup at breakneck speed with people and products - whilst retaining the core vision of making information easily accessible to all.\n\nThe very 1st slide John showed to team Google said OKRS: \"A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization\"\n\nI'll litter this blog with excerpts and stories that the book explored and I found most helpful.\n\nOKR short intro\nObjective is the WHAT is to bo achieved. These are significant. concrete. action oriented and ideally inspirational.\n\nKey Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound. aggressive yet reliastic. Most of all they're measurable and reliable.\n\nWhere an objective can be long-lived. rolled over for a year or longer. key results evolve as the work progresses. Once the KRs are completed -> the objective is achieved\n\nThus. OKRs channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse ops. lending purpose and unity to the entire org. This is supremely important at startups or young companies where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction\n\nThe maker of OKR\nAndy Grove. an Intel exec is credited for having created the management system of OKRs when Intel had taken up the responsibility of Operation Crush - a race to win in the 16-bit microprocessor market with their 8086 product in a time where cheaper and less performant products were eating market share.\n\nIt was the glorious story of how Intel dumped the business of memory-chip and went all-in on microprocessors and completely \"crushed\" every other contemporary compute company.\n\nHere. are the 1st tenets of this system. by Dr. Grove himself:\n\nLess is more\nSet goals from the bottom up\nNo dictating\nStay flexible\nDare to fail\nHere's a free OKR template for your use - link\n\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nProblem to Product\nA summary of my learnings from \"The Lean Product Playbook\" - of moving from problem to product\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n27 FEB 2023 ‚Ä¢ 6 MIN READ\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP\nLearning from Unusual Billionaires\nLearning from 7 unconventional stories - how a lasting. profitable business is to be built\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n15 DEC 2022 ‚Ä¢ 7 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!

It is a collection of stories of brilliant companies that made their dent in the world by continuously innovating. providing great service. and building powerful teams & stable assets.

Back of the envelope analysis quickly generates a ballpark figure using approximated or rounded figures. An estimate is more accurate than a wild guess but less exact than a formal calculation using precise numbers in a spreadsheet or other program. These computations are typical for folks who have a sudden inspiration for an idea or wish to estimate a quantity quickly.\n\nIn honor of physicist Enrico Fermi. back of the envelope computations are often referred to as Fermi issues. Fermi was renowned for his ability to approximate issues accurately even with very little data.\n\nIn this article. we will talk about this methodology's history. applications. and best practices. Furthermore. I will provide a storage cost analysis of Twitter 2.0 and a cheat sheet at the end so that you can conduct your estimations. Just a disclaimer - the calculations that are about to be added. are made with heavy assumptions - looking at Twitter 2.0 as a new service that we‚Äôll be building & basic components required for the same. The calculations don‚Äôt involve considerations of economies of scale. redundancy. replication and most estimations that involve scaling. We are just understanding a basic implementation of storage for the app. for the scale it is it\n\n\nTwitter 2.0‚Äôs System Design diagram shared by Elon Musk in November 2022 - Source\n\nWhy are back of the envelope calculations needed?\nThe calculation generally informs us if the design can satisfy the functional requirements. such as the number of supported users. response latency. and resource needs. For instance. when deciding between different architectural designs. the simplest question to ask is whether one server is enough. To get a ballpark figure. we can quickly calculate how many servers we would require. if not one.\n\nNotable Industry Applications\nSome of the use cases where back of the envelope calculation has been used:\n\nAn important Internet protocol. the Border Gateway Protocol. was sketcBeforein 1989 by engineers on the back of \"three ketchup-stained napkins\". and is still known as the three-napkin protocol.\nUTF-8. the dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web was designed by Ken Thompson and Rob Pike on a placemat.\nThe Bailey bridge is a type of portable. pre-fabricated. truss bridge and was extensively used by British. Canadian and US military engineering units. Donald Bailey drew the original design for the bridge on the back of an envelope.\nThe Laffer Curve. which claims to show the relationship between tax cuts and government income. was drawn by Arthur Laffer in 1974 on a bar napkin to show an aide to President Gerald R. Ford why the federal government should cut taxes.\nWe've looked at some of the important historical applications of the back of the envelope. now we'll examine the arithmetic process to see how we can utilise it to solve our own issues. This will help you retain this knowledge as well as expand your understanding of how these calculations work.\n\nGetting Started with Back of the Envelope\nWhenever we try to learn something new. we have to be well-versed with the most basic & frequently used tools. Similarly. when beginning system design estimations. we have to know certain common numbers that help us consolidate our understanding. A subset of these numbers. used for estimating the speed of a system. are known as ‚ÄúLatency Numbers.‚Äù Latency. as a term. helps measure the time it will take for data to pass from one point in a network to another. It is measured in milliseconds for most systems. For example. the latency of the best video chat applications. such as Google Meet is 100 milliseconds or less. This means it takes 100 milliseconds or less for data to be exchanged between the video chat participants‚Äô computers.\n\nHow can we implement this?\nBefore approximating the real utilization. we must acknowledge that our system has limited resources. For instance. we want to know if we can handle all user requests on a single server despite our servers only being equipped with 2GHz CPUs.\n\nHow can we guess the real usage?\n\nThe utilization must be divided into its component parts before being roughly estimated (and. if necessary. further divided) and combined.\n\nFor instance. we might anticipate 1K active users. each of whom submits 15 requests daily.\n\n15K requests per day. or 15K/86400 requests per second. are involved.\n\nAn effective method for assembling the components is to round tightly. Nobody likes to multiply by 86400. To give 0.2 seconds to serve a single request. let's round to 20K/100K. We need to set up at least 4 computers if we know that it takes 0.7 seconds to serve one request. Of course. you don't want to live on the edge. so let's increase the number of machines by a buffer and make it ten.\n\nHow to calculate quickly\nIf someone asked you to calculate: 2456000 x 4598; that would slow things down. wouldn‚Äôt it?\n\nThe simpler way to calculate quickly would be instead of spelling down a whole number. use small numbers paired with an abbreviation for magnitude (or. if necessary. exponents). 1K as opposed to 1000.\n\nWhen given a huge. excessively exact number. such as 7432. immediately translate it to 7K. Anyhow. you are estimating.\n\nThis format for numbers makes multiplication and division quick.\n\nKK is M. [K is Kilo; M is Mega]\n\nG/M is K. [G is Giga]\n\n4K7M = 28G.\n\nRound both of them towards a small multiple of a power of 2 or 10 to work with larger numbers.\n\n2714 ~= 3010 = 3000.\n6500/250 ~= 6400/256 ~= 100 * 2^6 / 2^8 ~= 100 / 2^2 = 25.\nWhere to start Back of the envelope?\nList the common use-cases of the system and decide which critical resources they require. You'll need a lot of storage for a document repository. Estimating document counts and sizes is a good place to start. but further usage will determine specifics. How frequently do new papers get added? The papers - can you search them? Are any indices required? Is the app more read-heavy or write-heavy?\n\nVaried use cases will probably require significantly different resource shapes. For instance. serving documents might require a lot of RAM but not CPU. whereas preprocessing new documents would require CPU but not RAM. Since you need to purchase machines that are maxed out on both dimensions. hosting all those services on homogeneous machines would waste CPU and RAM.\n\nSuch differences indicate those features should be split to different services. hosted on independent sets of machines.\n\nReal-world case study - Storage Costs borne by Twitter\n\nSource\n\nProblem: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements\nPlease note the following numbers are for this exercise only as they are not real numbers from Twitter.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n300 million monthly active users.\n50% of users use Twitter daily.\nUsers post 2 tweets per day on average.\n10% of tweets contain media.\nData is stored for 5 years.\nEstimations:\n\nQuery per second (QPS) estimate:\n\nDaily active users (DAU) = 300 million * 50% = 150 million\nTweets QPS = 150 million * 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500\nPeek QPS = 2 * QPS = ~7000\nLet‚Äôs start solving\nThere are 2 important queries that need to be addressed for any system:\n\n‚ÄúRequests per second‚Äù at the server level\n‚ÄúQueries per second‚Äù at the database level.\nLet‚Äôs start with ‚Äúrequests per second‚Äù & what inputs are required to estimate its number\n\nUsers: Twitter has 300 million active MAUs. Not every user on Twitter is an active post-maker. 50% use daily - 150 million DAU\nUsage per DAU: 10-25% make a tweet. Again. this doesn‚Äôt have to be exact; getting within an order of magnitude should be fine. Say each DAU. on average. makes 2 tweets: so 0.25%*2 = 0.5 tweets per DAU.\nScaling factor: Usage rate for a service has peaks & valleys throughout the day. Eg: The usage rate for your favorite e-commerce store or food delivery app will heavily increase in the case of discounts or sales in a particular festive season. We need to estimate how high the traffic would peak compared to the average. This would reflect the request per second peak where the design could potentially break. Most people tweet in the morning. so the tweet creation traffic is twice the average when US east coast wakes up.\nThus. total tweets in a day = 150 M DAU * (0.5 tweets/DAU) * (2x scaling factor in the morning)\nThus. requests per second = n/(number of seconds in a day) = n/86400 ~ 1500 tweets per second.\nLet‚Äôs now look at how much storage is required for storing multimedia files for tweets.\n\n150 million daily tweets. Say 10% of these tweets contain pictures of average size 300kB each & 1% of tweets contain videos of about 50MB each.\nLet‚Äôs assume that the files are replicated with 3 copies each & atleast stored for 5 years.\nStorage required for pictures = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.1 of tweets have images)* 300kB (image size) * 3copies = 13.5TB.\nStorage required for videos per day = (150 M ¬†tweets per day)* (0.01 of tweets have videos) * (50MB video size) * 3copies ~ 225TB.\nTotal storage required for multimedia files per day = 238.5TB\nJust the text for a tweet can be stored within 160B (i.e. 1280 bits ~ 160 characters per tweet on average)\nStorage required for tweets per day = 150 M * (160B tweet size) * 3copies = 72GB\nLet‚Äôs calculate overall storage cost for Twitter\nThus. we learnt that. for running Twitter. in the most basic sense. the following requirements must be met:\n\nAssuming no data compression & our simple 3x replication. in the most basic form - 238.5TB blob storage required for storing all the multimedia of tweets that arrive in a day. 72 GB storage in database is required just for storing the basic tweet content.\nTwitter was founded in 2006. However. it launched image sharing in 2011 & video sharing in 2013.\nThus. we can assume. that average storage required per day for videos uploaded by a growing user base can be our current estimate multiplied by a normalization factor of 0.6 (considering 15% of user growth on average. every year. since year of founding).\nThus. we have about (225TB video storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (9 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 443.5PB videos stored.\nSimilarly for image storage we have (13.5TB photo storage per day) * (365 days in a year) * (11 years since video sharing was launched) * 0.6 = 32.52PB images stored\nTo store total multimedia for 11 years worth tweets. in the most fault tolerant & redundant manner. we need - 443.5+32.52 ~ 476.02PB (this figure is close to the actual ballpark around 500PB that Twitter has officially shared here)\nTwitter uses AWS for storage of tweets & accompanying multimedia files. Say we use intelligent tiering by S3 to pay for data. that is most recent & popularly accessed. Other data. we can archive. & fetch on demand & pay for.\nEstimating the media storage cost\n476.02PB can be broken down into. say - 300 PB till 2019 (considering that video & images got introduced late) and 276PB after 2017.\nAssuming the worst case pricing of S3 (the standard pricing) - All the multimedia of the last 3 years‚Äô tweets can be stored in S3 regular access & the other. can be stored in S3 archives (so we save cost) Thus. as per S3 pricing values. we end up paying:\n\nFor 300PB in archive: 308.073.20 USD monthly\n\nFor 276PB in regular tier: 5.935.645.70 USD monthly\n\nEvery year. our estimate of Twitter. pays 6.243.718.90 USD monthly. to store our images & videos.\n\nEstimating the database cost for our tweets\nLet‚Äôs use AWS relational database DynamoDB to store tweet data in a structured form - such as user info. tweet text. number of likes & retweets.\nTwitter needs to store 72GB of tweets in a regular relational database. each day. to keep the lights on.\nAgain. estimating our normalization factor of 0.6 to aggregate tweet data. across 16 years since Twitter supporting text sharing right from the start. we get - (72 GB tweet data per day) *(365 days)* (16 years since tweeting was launched) * 0.6 = 252.28TB\nThus. using a standard on-demand DynamoDB (unoptimized for cost. but great for scale) - the storage cost comes to 603.355.92 USD monthly. to store our data.\nFor an actual analysis of all the databases Twitter uses. checkout this reference link\nHere‚Äôs the actual AWS calculator cost estimation performed for this purpose.\n\nThus. this most basic. unoptimized design of that we made. pays 82.164.897.81 USD = 82 million USD every year to AWS. to keep providing its storage services only.\n\nWe have not even begun to discuss the computing costs. the data science costs in the cloud. Also. to keep this article a light read. we haven‚Äôt taken into consideration scalability solutions such as caching. multi-AZ databases and several aspects of storage itself.\n\nThus. you might now understand why Elon Musk is bent on optimizing this system a lot & even implementing the ‚ÄúDeep Cuts‚Äù plan to reduce infrastructure costs by a billion. But trying to fire 50% of the workforce and have the rest leave because the ship is sinking still doesn't make sense. To top it off. if your major problem is infrastructure cost you don't fire engineers. you task engineers to reduce infrastructure costs. Now. we may not agree or disagree with this logic. but atleast we‚Äôve learnt how to ballpark the financial element of the same.\n\nCheat Sheet for Back of the Envelope\nWe studied a way of estimating the storage cost borne by Twitter. But what about getting the speed of a video-game streaming platform? Or the requests per second of a payment gateway?\n\nFear not. here are a few important numbers that we can use to estimate useful metrics of any software system & what corresponding technical requirements it must be able to satisfy.\n\nFor estimating storage\nByte Number Sizes\n\n\nImage Source\n\nData\n\nThe numbers vary depending on the language and implementation.\n\nchar: 1B (8 bits)\nchar (Unicode): 2B (16 bits)\nShort: 2B (16 bits)\nInt: 4B (32 bits)\nLong: 8B (64 bits)\nUUID/GUID: 16B\nObjects\n\nFile: 100 KB\nWeb Page: 100 KB (not including images)\nPicture: 200 KB\nShort Posted Video: 2MB\nSteaming Video: 50MB per minute\nLong/Lat: 8B\nFor estimating load in a given time duration\nThe following numbers are heavily rounded and help determine how often something needs to happen over a period of time.

It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers. you have to know how your subsystems perform. You can't make decent back of the envelope calculations if you don't know what's happening.\nMonitor and measure every part of your system so you can make these sorts of projections from real data.\nI hope you understood how systems are operated in terms of estimating engineering infrastructure requirements. provisions & costing.

However. the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta).\n\nTensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices). vectors (that have exactly one index). and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.\nTensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity. fluid mechanics. and general relativity.\nBeginner-friendly\nClearing the meaning. usage and confusions about tensors in ML and math\nTensors. a crucial concept in the field of machine learning. deep learning. and data science. often become a stumbling block for many learners. To fully grasp the idea. we'll break it down. explore examples. and demystify various related aspects such as rank. dimension. components. indices. size. and shape.\n\nWhat are Tensors?\nIn simple terms. tensors are a generalization of scalars. vectors. and matrices. They can be seen as multidimensional arrays of numbers. with each dimension known as a rank.\n\nA scalar is a single number. a tensor of rank 0.\nA vector is an array of numbers. a tensor of rank 1.\nA matrix is a 2D array of numbers. a tensor of rank 2.\nA 3D array. or a \"cube\" of numbers. is a tensor of rank 3.\nThe ranks continue to increase to define higher dimensional spaces.\n\nBreaking Down the Definition of a Tensor\nThe formal definition of a tensor. \"An nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules.\" often overwhelms beginners. So. let's simplify it:\n\n\"nth-rank tensor\": Rank refers to the number of dimensions or indices the tensor has. For example. a rank 1 tensor is a vector (which has one dimension). a rank 2 tensor is a matrix (which has two dimensions). and so on.\n\"m-dimensional space\": This refers to the size of each dimension. For a matrix (rank 2 tensor). this would be the number of rows and columns.\n\"m^n components\": Components are the individual elements or data points that make up the tensor. For example. in a matrix. each number is a component.\nSimplifying with Examples\nConsider a 3x3 image with three color channels (Red. Green. Blue). It is represented as a 3D array or a rank 3 tensor. with dimensions of 3 (height) x 3 (width) x 3 (color channels). It would have 3^3 or 27 components (individual color values for pixels).\n\nDelving Deeper: Case of a 4x4 Image\nLet's take a more specific example: a 4x4 pixel image with three color channels. Here. the tensor would have a rank of 3 (height. width. and color channels). The dimensions would be 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels). and there would be 4^3 or 64 components.\n\nThe indices here refer to the position of each component within the tensor. For example. you might reference the red color value of the pixel in the second row and third column as [2.3.1]. where '2' refers to the row. '3' refers to the column. and '1' refers to the red channel.\n\nThe size of this tensor would be calculated by multiplying the sizes of all its dimensions together. resulting in 4 (height) x 4 (width) x 3 (color channels) = 48. The shape of this tensor would be (4. 4. 3). describing the number of elements along each dimension.\n\nDifference Between Rank and Dimension\nWhile both terms describe the structure of a tensor. they represent different aspects. The rank is the number of dimensions. while the dimensions refer to the size (or length) of each of those dimensions. In the case of our 4x4 pixel image tensor. the rank is 3. and the dimensions are 4. 4. and 3.\n\nSample Log of a 4x4x3 Tensor\nA 4x4 pixel image with three color channels can be represented as a 3D array (or rank 3 tensor). Each pixel's color is represented by a 3-element vector (for the three color channels). and the image consists of a 4x4 grid of such pixels. giving us a shape of (4. 4. 3).\n\nA 4x4 pixel image with 3 color channels could be represented as a 4x4x3 tensor. like this:\n\n\ntensor = [\n    [  # First row of pixels\n        [230. 10. 10].    # Red-ish\n        [230. 230. 10].  # Yellow-ish\n        [10. 230. 10].   # Green-ish\n        [10. 230. 230]   # Cyan-ish\n    ].\n    [  # Second row of pixels\n        [10. 10. 230].   # Blue-ish\n        [230. 10. 230].  # Magenta-ish\n        [220. 220. 220]. # Light gray\n        [120. 120. 120]  # Gray\n    ].\n    [  # Third row of pixels\n        [30. 30. 30].    # Dark gray\n        [230. 50. 10].   # Different shade of red\n        [230. 230. 60].  # Different shade of yellow\n        [10. 60. 230]    # Different shade of blue\n    ].\n    [  # Fourth row of pixels\n        [40. 230. 40].   # Different shade of green\n        [50. 10. 230].   # Another shade of blue\n        [230. 40. 230].  # Another shade of magenta\n        [10. 40. 10]     # Dark green\n    ]\n]\n\n\n\nClearing the Confusion Around \"Dimension\"\nThe term \"dimension\" can lead to some confusion. In the context of tensors. \"dimension\" often refers to the depth of nested lists. not the geometric or mathematical space that a vector might represent. So. a vector like [3. 4] is a rank-1 tensor (or one-dimensional array) because it involves no nesting of lists. Its shape is considered to be (2.) because it contains two elements.\n\nIn summary. tensors. while initially appearing complex. can be demystified and understood through the step-by-step breakdown of their components and properties. As multidimensional arrays. they provide the foundation for manipulating data in machine learning and deep learning. making them a fundamental concept for anyone delving into these fields.\n\nAdvanced\nExploring more properties of tensors\nUnderstanding Covariance & Contravariance\nA vector can be expressed in terms of its contravariant or covariant components\n\nCASE 1: Expressing in terms of contravariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of components with basis vectors\n\nüí°\nWe need 1 index for each of the components as there is only 1 directional indicator per component. 1 index. 1 basis vector. per component\nIf we decrease the length of the ‚Äúbasic vectors‚Äù (in a vector space). then the number of components required to make up a vector increases. Because the index & the number of components change contrary to each other. they are known as contravariant components of a vector Describing a vector in terms of these contravariant components (eg : 2 i + 3 j + 4 k) is how we usually describe a vectors\n\n\nCASE 2: Expressing in terms of covariant components ‚Üí vector described in terms of dot-product with basis vectorsIf we decrease the length of the basis vectors. then the dot-product decreases & vice versa. Since these properties are varying in the same way. we say that these are covariant components of a vector.\n\n\nSpecifying the notation for covariant & contravariant components\n\n\nNow. say we take 2 vectors V & P\n\nüí°\nIndex (for this rank 2 tensor. i.e. a vector) = unique combination of basis vectors\nCASE 1: We multiply the contravariant values of V & P. On considering all possible ways. we get a matrix:\n\n[\n¬†\nùëâ\n1\nùëÉ\n1\nùëâ\n1\nùëÉ\n2\n¬†\nùëâ\n1\nùëÉ\n3\nùëâ\n2\nùëÉ\n1\nùëâ\n2\nùëÉ\n2\n¬†\nùëâ\n2\nùëÉ\n3\nùëâ\n3\nùëÉ\n1\nùëâ\n3\nùëÉ\n2\n¬†\nùëâ\n3\nùëÉ\n3\n¬†¬†\n]\n‚é£\n‚é°\n‚Äã\n  \n¬†V \n1\n P \n1\n \nV \n2\n P \n1\n \nV \n3\n P \n1\n \n‚Äã\n  \nV \n1\n P \n2\n \nV \n2\n P \n2\n \nV \n3\n P \n2\n \n‚Äã\n  \n¬†V \n1\n P \n3\n \n¬†V \n2\n P \n3\n \n¬†V \n3\n P \n3\n ¬†¬†\n‚Äã\n  \n‚é¶\n‚é§\n‚Äã\n \n\nThis will give us a tensor of rank 2 with 2 contra-variant index values. Here. each T value is called an element of this tensor. And since for each element. 2 indices (2 directional indicators are required) eg: Understanding by example. say we have a combination of 3 area vectors & 3 force vectors. To get the combination of all the forces on all the area vectors. for each such combination. we require 2 indices (i.e. 2 directional indicators ‚Üí 1 for the force & 1 for the area). We get 9 components. each with 2 indices (referring to 2 basis vectors)\n\n\n[\n¬†\nùëá\n11\nùëá\n12\n¬†\nùëá\n13\nùëá\n21\nùëá\n22\n¬†\nùëá\n23\nùëá\n31\nùëá\n32\n¬†\nùëá\n33\n]\n‚é£\n‚é°\n‚Äã\n  \n¬†T \n11\n \nT \n21\n \nT \n31\n \n‚Äã\n  \nT \n12\n \nT \n22\n \nT \n32\n \n‚Äã\n  \n¬†T \n13\n \n¬†T \n23\n \n¬†T \n33\n \n‚Äã\n  \n‚é¶\n‚é§\n‚Äã\n \n\nCASE 2: We multiply the covariant components of P with contravariant values of V .

Only 1 index i.e. 1 combo of basis vectors is required to know the location\n\n\nHere. \\($V^1 = 5. V^2 = 3. V^3 = 2$\\)\n\n\nA tensor of rank 2 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 2 basis vectors\n\n\nIn a tensor of rank 3 - we associate a number with every possible combination of 3 basis vectors - composed of the components of 3 basis vectors. We can create different descriptions of this tensor by using different contravariant & covariant components of the basis vectors\n\n\n\n\nMore mathematical facts\nWhile the distinction between covariant and contravariant indices must be made for general tensors. the two are equivalent for tensors in three-dimensional Euclidean space (Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry. intended to represent physical space) . and such tensors are known as Cartesian tensors.\nObjects that transform like zeroth-rank tensors are called scalars. those that transform like first-rank tensors are called vectors. and those that transform like second-rank tensors are called matrices. In tensor notation. a vector v would be written $v_i$. where i=1. .... m. and matrix is a tensor of type (1.1). which would be written $a_i^j$ in tensor notation.\nTensors may be operated on by other tensors (such as metric tensors. the permutation tensor. or the Kronecker delta) or by tensor operators (such as the covariant derivative). The manipulation of tensor indices to produce identities or to simplify expressions is known as index gymnastics. which includes index lowering and index raising as special cases. These can be achieved through multiplication by a so-called metric tensor $g_{ij}. g^{ij}. g_i^j$. etc.. e.g..\nTensor notation can provide a very concise way of writing vector and more general identities. For example. in tensor notation. the dot product u¬∑v is simply written u¬∑v = $u_iv^i$ If two tensors A and B have the same rank and the same covariant and contravariant indices. then they can be added in the obvious way.\nThe generalization of the dot product applied to tensors is called tensor contraction. and consists of setting two unlike indices equal to each other and then summing using the Einstein summation convention. Various types of derivatives can be taken of tensors. the most common being the comma derivative and covariant derivative.\nIf the components of any tensor of any tensor rank vanish in one particular coordinate system. they vanish in all coordinate systems. A transformation of the variables of a tensor changes the tensor into another whose components are linear homogeneous functions of the components of the original tensor.\nTensors in the context of machine learning\nThe property of tensors to maintains its meaning under transformations is used also by machine learning. where real world data is transformed into corresponding tensors & then heavy calculations are done on these tensors to get valuable insights.\n\n\nReference videos\nWhat is a tensor? - Link\nCovariant & Contravariant Matrices - Link\nSubscribe to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog\nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nSYSTEMS DESIGNING\nTwitter 2.0 at the Back of an Envelope\nLet's understand how we can do back of the envelope calculations. and view the Twitter's engineering challenges from the eyes of its decision makers.\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n1 DEC 2022 ‚Ä¢ 12 MIN READ\n\nEDUCATION\nThe Next Decade of Indian Higher Education\nA look into Indian Higher Education system and what its future looks like\n\nAnkit Sanghvi\n\nANKIT SANGHVI\n30 OCT 2022 ‚Ä¢ 8 MIN READ\nAnkit Sanghvi | Blog ¬© 2024\nLatest Posts\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGhost\nYou've successfully subscribed to Ankit Sanghvi | Blog!Could not sign up!
